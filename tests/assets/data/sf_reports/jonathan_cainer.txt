THE MOON IN THE 10TH HOUSE
The Moon is placed in the 10th House of your birth chart suggesting that you're ambitious and enjoy your job, spending much time in the workplace, working odd hours to make sure that you get ahead in your career. You've a need to be publicly recognised for your achievements,
and this need may or may not be satisfied during your lifetime. It's likely that you succeed in your chosen profession at some stage during your life, but whether or not this success is enduring depends on other sections of your birth chart. It's true to say that your professional life undergoes several changes during the course of your life, with rises to fame and popularity, and possible falls from grace. You're also likely to move into a completely different field of work at least once in your lifetime. 

THE SUN

THE SUN IN SAGITTARIUS
Your Sun is in the zodiac sign of Sagittarius indicating that you're a sunny and optimistic individual, with a love of adventure. In fact adventure plays a key role in your life, whether it be literally travelling around the globe, or metaphorically speaking exploring the world of ideas and philosophy. You're particularly enthusiastic about anything that expands your world
and helps you forget about daily chores. Religion, law, sport, philosophy, academia, and ethics are just some of the many areas which provide a gourmet of ideas for exploration. For these reasons you're also likely to be attracted to people from foreign lands, who help to give you a fresh and different perspective on life. You also enjoy setting goals, as looking forward to a new vision provides excitement.

THE SUN IN THE 1ST HOUSE
Your Sun is in the 1st House of your birth chart meaning that self-expression is an important aspect of your life. You are determined to have the freedom to explore your own personal interests and make your own way in the world. Some might call you arrogant and selfish and at times you may need to stop and consider other people's rights. However, you learn most through your own experiences, rather than relying on the advice of others. You may not realise it, but you also make a strong impression on those around you. They see you as assertive and independent, whether you feel it or not. Of course this does depend on other influences in your chart. You're frank and confident, proud and independent, and can be combative if you're opposed.  In ancient times the Sun was considered particularly strong when in the angular first house of a chart, highlighting your ability to live a hale and hearty life with
plenty of energy to ensure that you make an impact on your environment.
