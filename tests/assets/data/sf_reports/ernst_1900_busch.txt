CHART POINTS

THE MOON

THE MOON IN LIBRA
You have a need for harmony and peaceful surroundings, and will seek peace when under stress. Your mother may be social and harmonious.

THE MOON IN THE 12TH HOUSE
The Moon is placed in the 12th House of your birth chart suggesting that you're a born loner, enjoying a reclusive lifestyle. Even when you're surrounded by people, you find your own secret world in which to retreat. You're likely to suffer if you seek a public lifestyle. The secret to success in your life is to spend much of your time in seclusion rather than
attempting to seek prominence in the public eye. The more you seek to hold the limelight, the more you're prone to difficulties. This doesn't mean that you can never achieve fame and fortune. It simply means that you need to work behind the scenes as much as possible, even choosing a career that requires seclusion, or in institutions such as hospitals, libraries, museums and archives - isolated positions in remote places.

THE SUN IN AQUARIUS

them or hate them, you can't seem to escape them unless it is to form a new family of your own. Although you are attached to your original family members, as you mature you also feel a strong urge to leave the nest and put down roots of your own. You benefit from purchases of land,
