BaseQueryText
Your task is to match each person in List A to their correct description in List B.

Carefully read the names in List A and the descriptions in List B. Then, create a tab-delimited table that provides a numeric similarity score between each person in List A and each description in List B.

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:**
1.  Your entire response MUST be ONLY the tab-delimited table.
2.  Do NOT include any explanations, introductions, summaries, or conversational text before or after the table.
3.  The first row of the table must be a header row. The first column header must be "Name", and the subsequent column headers must be "ID 1", "ID 2", "ID 3", and so on, matching the number of items in List B.
4.  Each subsequent row must start with the person's name exactly as it appears in List A, followed by tab-separated numeric scores.
5.  Each score must be a number between 0.0 and 1.0, where 1.0 is a perfect match and 0.0 is no match.

**EXAMPLE OUTPUT FORMAT (for k=2):**
Name	ID 1	ID 2
Person X (1900)	0.10	0.95
Person Y (1950)	0.85	0.05
