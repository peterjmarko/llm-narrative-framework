## File Descriptions

This project uses a multi-stage data pipeline, where raw data is progressively filtered and transformed into the final experimental database.

### 1. Source & Filter Files (`sources/`)

These files represent the initial stages of data collection and curation.

-   **`adb_raw_export.txt`**: The raw, tab-delimited data dump of ~10,000 individuals from the Astro-Databank research database. This is the starting point for the entire pipeline.
-   **`filter_adb_raw.csv`**: A manually curated CSV file used to perform the first stage of filtering. It confirms which individuals have a valid Wikipedia page, a confirmed death date, and flags any known duplicates.
-   **`eminence_scores.csv`**: Contains the eminence score for each valid candidate, used to sort and select the final top 5,000 subjects for the study.
-   **`adb_filtered_5000.txt`**: The output of the `filter_adb_candidates.py` script. It contains the 5,000 subjects selected from the raw data, ready for the next processing step.
-   **`sf_data_import.txt`**: The output of the `prepare_sf_import.py` script. This file is a transformation of `adb_filtered_5000.txt` into the specific Comma Quote Delimited (CQD) format required for import into the Solar Fire astrology software.

### 2. Foundational Assets for Database Generation (`foundational_assets/`)

These files are the building blocks used by the `generate_database.py` script to construct the final personality descriptions.

-   **`sf_delineations_library.txt`**: The complete, raw "decompiled interpretations" library exported directly from Solar Fire. This serves as the source material for the neutralized text.
-   **`point_weights.csv` & `balance_thresholds.csv`**: Configuration files that define the core parameters of the "Balances Report" algorithm (e.g., how much weight each planet carries, the thresholds for a "strong" or "weak" classification).
-   **`neutralized_delineations/`**: This directory contains six CSV files of sanitized, third-person textual descriptions. They were created by using an LLM to rewrite the content of `sf_delineations_library.txt`, removing all esoteric jargon.

### 3. Primary Databases & Experiment Files (`data/`)

These are the final, high-level files used directly in the LLM experiments and for analysis.

-   **`full_candidate_database.csv`**: (Note: This file is a conceptual artifact, generated by combining the source files). It represents the complete list of all ~10,000 candidates with their associated metadata (filter status, eminence score, etc.) and a `SelectionStatus` column indicating why a candidate was included or excluded (e.g., `TOP_5000`, `NO_WIKI_CONFIRM`, `LOW_EMINENCE`).
-   **`subject_database.csv`**: This is the final, primary database used in all experiments, equivalent to the project's `personalities_db.txt`. It is a tab-delimited file containing the final 5,000 subjects with four columns: `Index`, `Name`, `BirthYear`, and the assembled, neutralized `DescriptionText`.
-   **`base_query.txt`**: A text file containing the prompt template for the LLM matching task.
-   **`country_codes.csv`**: A helper file that maps country/state abbreviations found in the raw data to standardized country names.
