List A below contains the name and birth year of k=6 famous people in random order. List B contains k=6 independently-derived personality descriptions in random order. Assess the similarity between the biography of each person in List A to each personality description in List B (for a total of k*k = 36 comparisons). You are expected to source the biographies of and any other relevant information about the k=6 named people.

Please provide your answer *only* in the format of a table with k+1 columns and k+1 rows, where k is the number of items in each list:
- The first row MUST be a header row.
- The first column MUST contain the person's name (and year) exactly as it appeared in List A.
- The subsequent k columns MUST be headed 'ID 1', 'ID 2', ..., 'ID k'.

Each cell in the scores part of the table (rows 2 to k+1, columns 2 to k+1) should contain a numerical score from 0.00 to 1.00 (to two decimal places) indicating how similar the Person in that row is the Description ID in that column. A score of 1.00 indicates the highest possible similarity. 

Separate all items in each row (including the header row) with a single tab character. Do not include any other text, explanations, or introductions before or after this table.

Example for k=3 (where PersonX, PersonY, PersonZ are the names from List A):
Name	ID 1	ID 2	ID 3
PersonX (YearX)	0.12	0.87	0.03
PersonY (YearY)	0.78	0.11	0.33
PersonZ (YearZ)	0.01	0.08	0.93

List A
[6 names]

List B
[6 descriptions]
