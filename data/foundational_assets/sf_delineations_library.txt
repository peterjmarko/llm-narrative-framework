*Introduction
These interpretations have been written to introduce you to the concepts of astrology and how to get started with your natal chart. Astrology is a complex and meaningful science which takes years to study and apply successfully, however, we would like to whet your appetite with this report from this program, and encourage you to deepen your understanding through other means.
|
|Astrology is a study of the connection between planets and life on Earth. It is based on a concept that energy patterns form between other planets and Earth; and that these energies affect our lives as individuals and communities.
|
|An astrological chart, also known as a horoscope, natal chart, or birth chart, records the relationship between the planets and the signs of the Zodiac. Charts can be calculated for the birth of a person, a community, an event or anything that seems momentous. The horoscope is as individual and unique as a fingerprint.
|
|When using these interpretations, please bear in mind that, inevitably, every chart will contain some contradictory influences, and as a result certain interpretations of different items in the same chart may seem difficult to reconcile. However, this may still be an accurate reflection of your chart, as it is likely that you do experience conflicting desires, events and circumstances in your life. Usually it is the responsibility of an astrologer to synthesise these apparent contradictions in order to present a cohesive and realistic interpretation of the dilemmas of the chart.

This Vertex placement may teach you about the sacredness of your body. You learn of its finely tuned energy system, its chakras and delicate nervous system and learn that you are required to treat it with consideration, love and respect.

This placement opens the doorway to higher consciousness through learning to value what you have to offer to the world. It is a placement that requires you to regularly assess what you feel are your true values - what is really important to you for quality of life. Money was originally designed to be a fair energy exchange for ideas, goods and labour so the Vertex in this House asks you to be scrupulously fair in all your financial dealings with others. If this is done well you become a focus point for the use of resources and can gain both financially and through status within the community. You may be the custodian of valuable or historical objects - perhaps those passed down the family line, or perhaps owned by the country. You are asked to care for, protect and treasure these items as they may have a purpose in the future. If used ethically and wisely a special talent or vocation will bring considerable financial gain and personal security.

In one period of your life there will be a short journey or holiday that you can only describe as meant to happen. This can profoundly change you.

The Vertex in the 4th House gives a profound connection to your country of birth and/or racial origins which deeply influences your way of being.

Whichever it is you will find your lives are deeply entwined and there is often the need to finish, or sometimes change for the better, what a parent has started.  Your home is crucially important to your wellbeing as it has a deeply spiritual or even magical affect on you.  Many people with this placement feel as though they are meant to live in a specific area and/or in a specific House. You can search and search for the right abode and know it immediately when you see it, you can move mountains to attain it and feel great relief and peace when you move in. You need to be able to feel connected to the place where you live and able to put down roots for the next generation. 
|The AntiVertex in the 10th  House will draw you to people in positions of administration who can help you attain your goals. You will always be connected to influential people and have at least one destined connection with a powerful person.

*Vertex in 5th House
The Vertex in the 5th House of your Chart indicates your doorway to higher awareness is through love.  This placement can give intense initiations in all matters to do with love.  It can involve children, both your own and those whom are under your care. The initiation is to be able to give love without judgment and learn the difference between 'love' and' like'.  This is a highly creative placement where you are asked to create according to the nature of sign that contains the Vertex. It is often quite difficult to open the door to this creative field, but once you do a whole wider world opens for you as well.  Sport can open the door to a more powerful way of experiencing life. The discipline and commitment required by most forms of sport develop your ability to live life joyfully and successfully.

*Vertex in 7th House
Your doorway to higher awareness is through relationships. This can describe all forms of one-to-one relationships from soul mates through to business partners and even your deepest enemies.  You reach out to others and do not feel complete unless you can relate to them in some way. You search for your life partner and may have a destined relationship that changes your life. Sometimes battling an enemy opens the door to a profound understanding of your own nature and through that, the nature of those who originally seemed quite alien to you. Through relationships you learn about yourself and others and grow to understand that we are all part of the whole and all have a function in this world. As part of your growth of wisdom you may be drawn to be an advocate for another - the legal profession, counselling, speaking out for the oppressed or even a marriage celebrant are possible outlets for this need.  The area that is right for you becomes a vocation rather than just a job.
|The AntiVertex in the 1st House will require you to love and respect the body you have been given for this life experience and care well for your environment. You will learn that if you care for yourself others will love you. If you don't care for yourself others will tend to treat you with disrespect.

*Vertex in 8th House
Your doorway to higher awareness is through deep and often intense experiences. The 8th House covers areas in life that are usually quite profound - matters of life and death, the gamut of sexual experiences, surgery, research, and all recondite areas.  The nature and sometimes the compulsions of sexuality can be indicated by the Vertex in this House.  This placement can give experiences that run the gamut from forced sex to tantric sex and even celibacy, but whatever experience you have, it completely changes your perspective of the world.  As the Vertex axis is the doorway to other realities, the Vertex in the 8th House gives an interest in the process of dying and worlds beyond death. Many psychics who can talk to spirits have this placement. You may have a vocation to research deeper or hidden areas in life. Psychologists and psychiatrists who probe the depths of the human mind and emotions; scientists who research the atomic structures of our reality; surgeons who are enthralled by the structures and functions of the physical body and those who study occult and recondite subjects are four areas that spring to mind.  Alternative healing methods can be a passion for those with the Vertex in this  House as you realise that these areas offer a much greater understanding of the energy field of the body and the physical and emotional needs of living entities than allopathic medicine.
|The AntiVertex in the 2nd House will bring to you those with an affinity to nature or who are stable and secure. These people can help keep you stable whilst you have intense experiences or apply your mind to the deeper areas of life.  

*Vertex in 9th House
This placement can occur if you were born in the Tropics.  The 9th House is the House of exploration, whether physical, intellectual or spiritual. With the Vertex in this House you have a destiny to expand your horizons far beyond the culture into which you were born.  Contact with other cultures that are vastly different to your own can be the first step in this process, you may even find you are far more drawn to a foreign culture's religion or spiritual practices than those of your birth land. Your doorway to higher consciousness and to other realities can be opened through spiritual practises and techniques for developing your inner vision. The study of history and particularly the long cycles in history can be a source of enlightenment for you. You are particularly drawn to very ancient history and the cultures of those times as these can open doors to realities that are completely new and different to your own. Travel and adventure give opportunities for amazing experiences which open doors to new levels of understanding of yourself and your relationship with the environment.
|The AntiVertex in the 3rd House will draw people to you who are able to help you communicate your perception, experience and high levels of knowledge to the world. It gives you the ability to write and speak about your experience and therefore inspire others to seek their own truth.

*Vertex in 10th House
It is very rare to find the Vertex in the 10th House, but the AntiVertex here can take on this function. The Vertex in the 10th House gives a public life and a destiny connected to career and/or a destined career - something that you must do in this life. This destiny can come about in very strange ways at times. Your doorway to higher awareness comes through understanding management or government. On some level you will learn the needs of people and how to balance this with fair and just administration. You will develop an understanding of the different ways people think and feel and learn how to put the round peg in the round hole, the square peg in the square hole and how to liaise with both so neither feels left out.  You have a destined connection with a parent, who may be prominent in their field. This parent greatly influences you for good or ill and your relationship can affect a number of people who are involved in the same area. Your test is to be able to take the life given to you by this parent and turn it into something that delights and fulfils you.
|The AntiVertex in the 4th House will draw you to those who can give you a safe and secure home, a place where you can put your feet up, relax and be yourself. This is crucial to enable you to cope with the demands of a public life.

*Vertex in 11th House
The Vertex in the 11th House is highly unlikely. This placement will give a desire to benefit the community in some way. It will draw you to groups and causes that help humans, animals or even plants.  Your initiation into higher consciousness involves the willingness to develop a sense of the global community of all life forms on earth - and perhaps even in the solar system. This lifetime you are destined to meet someone who has a most powerful effect on you, someone who is a friend to you but also highly skilled or very wise in their field. You deeply respect this person and they act as a mentor who opens the door to new and different approaches to life.
|The AntiVertex in the 5th House will draw you to creative people whose skills help you express your ideals.

*Vertex in 12th House
This placement is highly unlikely. The doorway to higher consciousness is strongly stimulated with this placement and it can signify highly developed psychic abilities. You may find that you have very powerful, detailed dreams that can either foretell the future or give you insight into current problems. Your sensitivity enables you to know what others are feeling, both physically and emotionally, but at times you can get this mixed up with your own feelings and be unable to tell whether it is yourself or another. For this reason it is important to continuously clear your own energy field through spiritual practices and through the use of water - for example daily swims, baths or showers. If you wish, your imagination can be used to create beautiful films, stories and theatre as this Vertex placement gives excellent 'picture making' abilities. This can be the placement of a 'world server' - someone who has dedicated their life to the betterment of all creatures on earth. You may use the resources of institutions to help yourself and others. You have a destined connection to an aunt or uncle.
|The AntiVertex in the 6th House will draw you to practical people who help you manifest your compassion and ideals.

*BlackMoon in 1st House
If you are happy then everyone around you is happy. Conversely, when you are upset it follows that other people are also upset. You think that this is because of other people's behaviour, but you are the one who has an impact on those around you. Whether you realise it or not you have a dark side of your nature, in that you inadvertently lash out when you are upset. Occasionally this placement of the Black Moon in the 1st House of your Horoscope can indicate withdrawal from the company of others. Whether you withdraw or lash you, you blame others. You accuse others of doing wrong, and yet it is your unhappiness that is unsettling your colleagues or loved ones. Sometimes your own dark feelings can affect your physical or mental health. Once you claim your own feelings and break the cycle of blame, you are free of self-defeating behaviour. Self-understanding and acceptance bring relief, and perhaps joy into your life. You gain wisdom and may also choose to counsel others.

*BlackMoon in 2nd House
Problems arise in your life when it comes to money. You are likely to blame others for your money woes, but actually it is unlikely to be their fault. Your own self-defeating behaviour is, in some way, contributing to any short-fall in your income. The good news is that you can break the cycle once you acknowledge and discover the ways in which you are sabotaging your financial success. It is possible that your self-esteem is somehow linked to your monetary challenges. Perhaps you need to value your skills more and change jobs? Maybe you are procrastinating on a business deal? Or are you afraid of taking a financial risk? Perhaps you are too rash? Are you overspending, compensating for a lack of esteem and happiness? Whatever the scenario you are able to face the truths and create more financial freedom for yourself, and your loved ones.

*BlackMoon in 3rd House
How many times has saying what you think landed you in trouble in your life? Do you blame others? It is their fault because they don't understand, listen or care? Actually you might not realise it but your words can sometimes be harsh. Your darker feelings bubble to the surface and your loved ones can receive quite a tongue lashing. When they react then you blame them for their cruel words, not realising that you intitiated the argument. The truth hurts. If not careful you can indulge in all of the negative traits associated with this 3rd House of communication - whining, nagging, arguing, berating and criticising. Fortunately you have the ability to face the truth, to delve into the origins of the feelings that lead to you speaking out, and acknowledging the impact of your words on your loved ones. Once you have done this then you are wise beyond your years. You can lend a listening ear to other people's problems. Your understanding means that you may make an excellent counsellor or advocate.

*BlackMoon in 4th House
Whether you realise it or not you have a dark side of your nature, and you cause some upset for your family. You may believe that your family is the problem or that you have a right to express yourself, but the truth is that in some way you running away from your duties at home. You may expect family members to rescue you, soothing or solving your emotional problems. Deep down though you know that some aspect of your behaviour is upsetting your loved ones and needs to change. Even if your problem is something beyond your control you know that you need to stop lashing out at family members, expecting them to come to your rescue. The Black Moon's gift is the opportunity to bring unconscious or self-defeating behaviour into the light of day where it can no longer run amok.

*BlackMoon in 5th House
Whether you realise it or not you have a dark side of your nature in that you would rather play than take responsibility for your life. You can be a bit of a rabble-rouser. Your own creative pursuits are paramount, fulfillling a deep need within you. So much so that you feel that others, particularly children, are standing in your way. You may blame other people, perhaps even your own children, for preventing you from following your passionate interests. Nevertheless it is you who needs to find a balance between fun and duty. The Black Moon's gift is the opportunity to bring unconscious or self-defeating behaviour into the light of day where it can no longer run amok. Once you have found this balance then you may be an excellent teacher, artist, and parent.

*BlackMoon in 6th House
The Black Moon is in the 6th House of your birth chart indicating that work can be a bit fraught at times. You may have trouble organising your diary and work schedule believing this to be the fault of others. You are given too many duties, your co-workers interupt your thoughts, the days are not long enough... Your list of complaints is endless. The problem lies within you rather than in others. You need to organise your own daily work-load ensuring that you assert your own rights. You have a right to say "no" if you are given too much work. You have a right to tell colleagues that you are busy to talk etc. You do not need to be a martyr. Nor do you need to overload yourself in an attempt to feel good about yourself. You need to value your contribution and take care of your own health and well-being each day. Others are not responsible. Once you have mastered these skills then you are a power to contend with at work. You may even choose a job associated with workers' rights.

*BlackMoon in 7th House
Whether you realise it or not you have a dark side of your nature, in that you are never satisfied when it comes to your major relationship. It is possible that you don't wish to marry because you can't find someone who measures up. Alternatively you may make a commitment, only to complain incessantly about your less-than-perfect mate. You find it difficult to be satisfied in a committed relationship, because all you see is the dark side of your spouse. The problem is that you are not seeing things clearly. It is likely that the intimacy demanded by marriage is triggering a subconscious memory of your parents' relationship. Whether you realise it or not an unsavoury aspect of your parents' union is playing on your subconscious mind. You seek perfection in your partner as a way of avoiding the emotional pain associated with old memories. Once you have acknowledged this reality then you start to break free and find a loving and rewarding bond.

*BlackMoon in 8th House
The Black Moon placed in the 8th House of your birth chart can reveal intimate details of your life that you would, perhaps, prefer stayed forgotten. This is because the darker aspects of the Black Moon are associated with sexuality, birth, death, debt, lust, greed and other such intimate matters.  It is possible that you attract, albeit inadvertently, the darker elements of society into your life. This can vary from the spouse who gambles irresponsibly to neighbourhood associates turning violent. You don't know why strange things happen to you, but they do. The challenge for you is to face the depths of your own dark side and hold it to the light. You need to delve beyond the norm, to discover the undercurrents at play. Rather than blame others for disrupting your peace of mind, thank them. They present your opportunity to face your own emotional, and psychic, depths.

*BlackMoon in 9th House
In affect you have a Goddess in the house of the Gods. This is not a comfortable placement indicating that you are at odds with society's establishment. You are likely to blame pillars of society for all of their faults - their rigid religious principles, unfair laws, infringement of civil rights etc. The truth is that you are rebellious. Your philosophies are quite different. If you have a reckless need to rebel then you are likely to cause strife, both for yourself and for those around you. However, if you can learn to agree to disagree with individuals, and society as a whole, then you can enjoy your unique approach. You may then be an excellent teacher, preacher, law-maker or philosopher.

*BlackMoon in 10th House
Whether you realise it or not you have a dark side of your nature, in that you are ambitious to the point of over-riding other people on your way to the top. It is likely that you don't see this side of your nature, believing rather that you are excellent at your job, better than most others. You have an air of superiority that can irk your colleagues, and you don't even realise it. The Black Moon's gift is the opportunity to bring unconscious or self-defeating behaviour into the light of day where it can no longer run amok. Therefore you need to face the truth - your need to be the best is self-defeating. Others are just as capable. You need to learn to appreciate your colleague's skills and show them the respect that they deserve. This will, in turn, increase other people's respect for you.

*BlackMoon in 11th House
Friendships are a little fraught in your lifetime. You may feel that your friends fail to live up to your expectations, that you cannot count on them, or perhaps that they don't listen. The Black Moon is in the 11th House in your birth chart indicating that you like to be part of a group, to be connected to like-minded friends and to socialise. However, you often feel rejected and you believe that it is others who are rejecting you. In fact the opposite is likely to be true. You may not realise that you are quite fixed in your ideas, or that you are imposing your thoughts and feelings on others expecting them to agree with you. Any sign of disagreement is viewed as a lack of support. It is this and your inability to accept differences in your friends that triggers any social problems that you may encounter. Of course, you can join a group with similar ideals, but sooner or later individuals within this group are likely to hold different opinions and values. You need to learn to face your own intolerance. If you can learn to agree to disagree then you are likely to enjoy connections with other people from all walks of life. Your social life, and any work with groups, is more enjoyable when you learn to be flexible in your attitude.

*BlackMoon in 12th House
Whether you realise it or not you have a dark side of your nature, in that you delve too deeply into certain matters in your life. You believe that other people are the problem and perhaps they are. However, you need to focus on lighter matters. You are to apt to get lost in the imaginary world rather focus on mundane matters. You can put this ability to concentrate for long periods to good use later in life, but first you have to learn some self-disciplined.

*AntiVertex in 1st House
Your doorway to higher awareness is through relationships. This can describe all forms of one-to-one relationships from soul mates through to business partners and even your deepest enemies.  You reach out to others and do not feel complete unless you can relate to them in some way. You search for your life partner and may have a destined relationship that changes your life. Sometimes battling an enemy opens the door to a profound understanding of your own nature and through that, the nature of those who originally seemed quite alien to you. Through relationships you learn about yourself and others and grow to understand that we are all part of the whole and all have a function in this world. As part of your growth of wisdom you may be drawn to be an advocate for another - the legal profession, counselling, speaking out for the oppressed or even a marriage celebrant are possible outlets for this need.  The area that is right for you becomes a vocation rather than just a job.
|The AntiVertex in the 1st House will require you to love and respect the body you have been given for this life experience and care well for your environment. You will learn that if you care for yourself others will love you. If you don't care for yourself others will tend to treat you with disrespect.

*AntiVertex in 2nd House
Your doorway to higher awareness is through deep and often intense experiences.  The 8th  House covers areas in life that are usually quite profound - matters of life and death, the gamut of sexual experiences, surgery, research, and all recondite areas.  The nature and sometimes the compulsions of sexuality can be indicated by the Vertex in this House.  This placement can give experiences that run the gamut from forced sex to tantric sex and even celibacy, but whatever experience you have, it completely changes your perspective of the world.  As the Vertex axis is the doorway to other realities, the Vertex in the 8th House gives an interest in the process of dying and worlds beyond death. Many psychics who can talk to spirits have this placement. You may have a vocation to research deeper or hidden areas in life. Psychologists and psychiatrists who probe the depths of the human mind and emotions; scientists who research the atomic structures of our reality; surgeons who are enthralled by the structures and functions of the physical body and those who study occult and recondite subjects are four areas that spring to mind.  Alternative healing methods can be a passion for those with the Vertex in this  House as you realise that these areas offer a much greater understanding of the energy field of the body and the physical and emotional needs of living entities than allopathic medicine.
|The AntiVertex in the 2nd House will bring to you those with an affinity to nature or who are stable and secure. These people can help keep you stable whilst you have intense experiences or apply your mind to the deeper areas of life.  

*AntiVertex in 3rd House
This placement can occur if you were born in the Tropics.  The 9th House is the House of exploration, whether physical, intellectual or spiritual. With the Vertex in this House you have a destiny to expand your horizons far beyond the culture into which you were born.

Your doorway to higher consciousness and to other realities can be opened through spiritual practises and techniques for developing your inner vision. The study of history and particularly the long cycles in history can be a source of enlightenment for you.

For this reason it is important to continuously clear your own energy field through spiritual practices and through the use of water - for example daily swims, baths or showers. If you wish, your imagination can be used to create beautiful films, stories and theatre as this Vertex placement gives excellent 'picture making' abilities. This can be the placement of a 'world server' - someone who has dedicated their life to the betterment of all creatures on earth. You may use the resources of institutions to help yourself and others. You have a destined connection to an aunt or uncle.

This Vertex placement may teach you about the sacredness of your body.

|This placement opens the doorway to higher consciousness through learning to value what you have to offer to the world. It is a placement that requires you to regularly assess what you feel are your true values - what is really important to you for quality of life. Money was originally designed to be a fair energy exchange for ideas, goods and labour so the Vertex in this House asks you to be scrupulously fair in all your financial dealings with others. If this is done well you become a focus point for the use of resources and can gain both financially and through status within the community. You may be the custodian of valuable or historical objects - perhaps those passed down the family line, or perhaps owned by the country. You are asked to care for, protect and treasure these items as they may have a purpose in the future.

*WhiteMoon in 1st House
Do you wear robes of silver fabric or have a crescent shaped mark on your body? Why? In some ways you are the embodiment of Selena the White Moon Goddess. You are well aware of your earthly responsibilities and yet you also like to fly into a different realm and light up the sky. You are probably not aware of the sway that you hold over others, the force of your own personality. Once you have gained this awareness you can be a force for good works.

*WhiteMoon in 2nd House
Spiritual values are more important than money. This is a lesson that you may or may not have learnt, depending on other influences in your birth chart.

|

*WhiteMoon in 3rd House
Any goddess has joy and authority in this house of your birth chart. Therefore you can be a force to be reckoned with whenever you communicate your thoughts and feelings.

*WhiteMoon in 5th House
You are well aware of the need for loving and responsible care of young children. As a young child you may be responsible for the care of younger children. As you mature you are likely to be a caretaker of children. These may not be your own children.

Your fate is to care for each child who enters your world with the same love, compassion and warmth.

*WhiteMoon in 6th House
You are well aware of the sanctity of everyday life, the importance of every little task that adds to the big pictures. Your own schedule is likely to be filled with such tasks - your own and other people's. No errand is too much. At times you may feel like a servant, but on the whole you are happy to be so. This is because you realize the importance of servitude. You have the ability to escape, in your own mind, through the realization that God's work is often in the details, the unnoticed deeds. You have the ability to be the power behind the thrown. It is also possible that you share your life with a beautiful lover, someone who needs your help on a daily basis.

*WhiteMoon in 7th House
The myth of Selene holds many significant clues for her placement in your 7th House of relationships. Selene, the goddess of the Moon, falls in love with Endymion on her travels on her chariot through the skies. She comes down to earth and unites with him. The story goes that Selene so loves her man that she cannot bear the thought of him dying. She uses her magic of the night to put him into a deep sleep forever. This way she may see him, unchanging, for all eternity. Can you see any strains of this myth running through your own relationships? It is likely that when you fall in love you do so completely and deeply, feeling as though you cannot live without your beloved. Even if you are usually an independent person traveling far and wide, you enter into a different part of your being when you become entwined in a lover's arms. Your lover quickly becomes your sole source of comfort. You may sacrifice your own life journey, surrendering to your partner's way of life?  As you learn the lesson of Selene then you gain wisdom and understanding in the area of relationships. You may regain the balance that you so desire within a relationship or you may shy away from a marriage so that you can fulfill your own destiny. It is possible that you take up counseling as a career so that you can share your wisdom with others.

*WhiteMoon in 8th House
You are a resourceful person, knowing how to utilize the earth's resources to best serve everyone. As such you are nobody's slave. You march to the tune of your own drum. You are unlikely to be a long-term employee, unless you are being paid large sums of money. You know your own worth and respect other people's. Therefore you are likely to work independently, acknowledging the ebb and flow of the financial market. You are able to rise above the everyday flow of money and resources and see the bigger picture. You are also well aware of the metaphysical laws that are the backbone of earthly matters. Sexuality is also a powerful force in your life. As such you may attract a partner largely on the basis of a strong sexual desire. Eventually you may teach others about managing money, sex and spiritual laws.

*WhiteMoon in 9th House
You revere all that is feminine and goddess-like and yearn to express your reverence through your life's work. This means that you are on a journey searching for means to learn, heal and teach. You may have a love of mathematics, science or some such logical field of learning. However, it is also possible that you apply your logical mind to philosophy, religion or the arts. You may have a more down-to-earth career, but travel to different parts of the world. You are destined to inspire others to reach beyond their limits and to remind those around you of the important contribution that women make to the world.

*WhiteMoon in 10th House
The placement of Selena in the 10th House is a reminder, if you did not realize it already, that your mother has made a significant contribution to your life direction. This is true of most people, but your mother has a more potent effect than some. Your role as a parent is also likely to be a prominent part of your life story. You are destined to apply logic to your career choice, but you need to make sure that logic is not overriding matters of the heart. If you keep purity of purpose, and spiritual goals, in the forefront of your mind then you are likely to make a significantly positive impact on the people who matter most in your life.  You may even choose a career that helps other people understand the role of mothers and families.

*WhiteMoon in 11th House
You are committed to the concept that much can be achieved through the power of the collective. In other words friends and groups take precedence over individuals, in your life. Groups such as Trade Unions, the Women's Movement, boards, committees etc are likely to play a prominent role in your life. You respect individual rights, but you believe that people can achieve a lot more when they pool resources. To you this is a logical. You are destined to play a significant role in at least one organization or group. This could be a local neighbourhood club, or it could be a large organization. Naturally politics is also likely to feature in your life, as you become involved with many people.

*WhiteMoon in 12th House
There is a deep, contemplative side to your nature. It is possible that you are a natural introvert and therefore your reflective tendencies are fully explored through meditation, prayer, communing with nature or just being a recluse. However, if you are more extraverted then you may take other people by surprise by suddenly withdrawing from your usual activities in favour of quiet periods. A spiritual group may be a good source of comfort and may also be a conduit for you sharing your wisdom. You are more likely to seek an alternative group rather than an orthodox one. Long periods in nature may be deeply restorative.

*Sedna in 1st House
The ocean is likely to fascinate you. Depending on other aspects of your birth chart you may either be a strong swimmer, delighting in the depths of the sea, or you may have a strong aversion. Either way oceanic themes keep cropping up in your life. This may also mean that you have a fascination for all things esoteric. You have hidden depths and may be a little reclusive at times, needing to withdraw deep within yourself in order to sort through your thoughts and feelings. You may even be a little narcissistic, resorting to feelings of victimization. You need to be aware of the affect that you have on other people when you are in this frame of mind. You may not be aware of the true manner in which you are presenting yourself and may need to turn down the volume on your complaints. Your lesson is to reach out to other people, see things from their point of view and realize the depths of your own strength.

*Sedna in 2nd House
You have deep feelings about money. Whether you are rich or poor, money holds a prominent place in your life, stirring deeps feelings that perhaps you don't even fully understand. All you know is that money continues to be a central theme. You may feel that the world, or someone, has been unjust and that you have suffered monetarily as a result. Perhaps your family was dirt poor when you were young. Now it seems that you are determined to redress the imbalance. It is also possible that you have had to take care of someone else financially and felt it to be a burden. Perhaps you made a large amount of money and invested unwisely. It is also possible that you benefit by victim like behaviour, crying poor so that other people give you money to help you feel better. Your lesson is to overcome your deep feelings about financial hardship and injustice, and to turn your attention to other values. What do you really value in life? What are your passions? An interesting exercise could be to sit by the ocean and ask yourself some deep and meaningful questions about money matters.

*Sedna in 3rd House
You are a very insightful individual, able to see to get to the heart of matters in any communication. The written and spoken words are powerful tools in your life. Your intuition is strong. You need to learn to trust your own insights, and to respect the hidden depths that you see in your neighbours, friends and siblings. You may, unwittingly, stir up hidden feelings in others. It is almost as if you have taken a big stick and put it into the ocean and stirred up lots of sand and mud. Other people may not be as capable as you of combining heart and mind. Therefore you need to use your powers for the good of others, biding your time and listening. You can sit very still and listen to other people's stories. This is a gift. You can also sit still by yourself. The ocean is likely to be a calming force in your life, helping you to focus on what is important. When you are feeling stressed, perhaps even depressed, you can go to the nearest beach to uplift your spirits. If you live faraway from the ocean you may benefit from pictures, or ocean creatures as ornaments. Playful seals may hold a special appeal.

*Sedna in 4th House
Do you live by the ocean? If not, why not? You can be deeply satisfied by living next to the large oceanic expanse, particularly drawing comfort from the sea life. If you do not, or have not, lived by the sea then perhaps you have traveled across a large expanse of ocean to live in another place? Family is a great source of joy, and perhaps pain. You have deep feelings, almost bottomless sometimes, in connection with your family. This can be either your childhood family, or the family that you form as an adult, or both. At times you may not realize the depth of your own feelings, and you do need to be careful of feeling like the victim within your own family. Of course it is possible that you grew up in a dysfunctional, perhaps even violent, family and that you were indeed the brunt of the negativity. This could have been connected to your father, or your father's family history. However, it is also possible that you simply felt lost in a sea of emotions and needed to escape to find your own sense of belonging. Your process of self-discovery is likely to be a rewarding one, as long as you don't become too introverted, living a cave-like existence. 

*Sedna in 5th House
Somewhere deep inside you is a longing to pursue an artistic talent or career. If you are lucky, and depending on other aspects of your birth chart, you can successfully immerse yourself in creative waters. If you are sacrificing your gifts in order to pursue a more practical path then you may become frustrated and ultimately sad and withdrawn. It is important that you dig deep and follow your dreams. Your talent is unlikely to be discovered within the four walls of your home. This placement of Sedna can also indicate a deep and abiding love for children, either your own or other people's. At some stage of your life you may cross a large expanse of water in order to create a better world for children, or to pursue your creative dreams. Listen to the longing of your own heart.

*Sedna in 6th House
This is a tricky placement of the tiny planetoid Sedna because it indicates that sometimes the demands of the everyday world get on top of you. In others words sometimes life's practicalities just seem all too difficult. As a result in your younger years you may feel a little lost when it comes to ordinary things such as, cleaning your room, doing your homework and making it to meals on time. As you mature small, but serious, tasks such as paying bills, putting out the garbage and servicing the car may never get done. The trick to this placement is find the meaning within everyday tasks. For instance the adage "cleanliness is next to Godliness" gives meaning to keeping clean and tidy. Other such adages may help. On a deeper level you could really benefit from meditation, prayer, regular exercise, a healthy diet and other such disciplines. For you rituals are relevant. You may also gain comfort from water pets such as fish or frogs, or small sea creatures. A daily walk by the ocean may be soothing. Once you have found meaning and pleasure in the little tasks then you are well able to handle the bigger ones.

*Sedna in 7th House
The simplest and most practical explanation of this placement of Sedna is that you need to find someone different, or someone connected with water as your marriage partner. You have a feminine planet in the area of your chart that is associated with marriage. Therefore your partner, whether male or female, needs to be an understanding and softer type of person. However, you should avoid anyone who appears to be bitter or acting like a perpetual victim. You need to feel a deep connection, one that crosses all boundaries. You may also travel across the water to meet your loved one, or they might travel to you. It is possible that your marriage involves some type of sacrifice, such as you living across the waters away from your own family so that you can marry your spouse. However, it can also mean that you feel deeply satisfied with your choice. 

*Sedna in 8th House
This can be a tricky placement for the tiny planetoid Sedna. The metaphysical 8th House of your birth chart already holds a lot of deep and meaningful treasures and Sedna is an expert at delving in. The problem is who is going to get you out of deep waters if you travel too far in? It is likely that you will have one of two paths, depending on the rest of your birth chart. One path is to avoid delving into esoteric matters at all. You doggedly refuse to admit that there may be a God, calling yourself an atheistic. You also refuse to merge with another human being in an intimate manner. This means that your sexuality is repressed, you do not share money well and you refuse to do business with another person. You can manage quite well by skimming over the surface, fearing the depths. On the other hand you could be the type of person to throw yourself in the deep end. You search the libraries, the Internet, the halls of learning and any resource you can find to discover the meaning of money, business, sex, relationships and the universe. You are diving for treasure and the more that you look, the more that you are likely to find it.

*Sedna in 9th House
You are a natural born philosopher with a deep understanding of esoteric matters. You are able to delve into any expansive subject and find the truth buried deep within. This is likely to be a profound spiritual or religious understanding, however; you may also be a learned scholar of law, science, politics, government policies and other such matters. You are likely to excel when you can immerse yourself in your studies. You may be the perennial student, enjoying the halls of learning far longer than any of your peers. As you grow in stature others turn to you for advice, and you may become a teacher, tutor or lecturer. You need to be wary that they don't shoot the messenger as you speak the truth. You may be tempted to be a martyr for your cause, being forced to withdraw from your chosen path because others don't like what you are telling them. You may even take a long journey across the waters to escape victimization. You are a zealot for digging up the truth, the crux of any matter. Do you realize how close you journey to the edge in your search for answers? Others may not appreciate your zeal, particularly if they are flouting the law. You need to learn to use your wits to protect yourself. This is not something that comes naturally to you, unless you have other strengths depicted in your birth chart.

*Sedna in 10th House
This placement of the tiny planetoid Sedna can indicate that your mother has played a vital role in your life. She may be a profound and wise influence, or she could be a deeply disturbing one. Either way her strengths and weaknesses have shaped the course of your life, perhaps even your chosen career. Even if you have deep hurts associated with your mother, or early life, you have the ability to delve into your feelings and use them for the good of others. Hence you may choose a career in the helping professions, or you may direct your energies into positive parenting. This placement of Sedna can also mean that you are prominent in your chosen field because of your integrity, your ability to problem solve and your insights. You are likely to be held in high regard by society.

*Sedna in 11th House
You sacrifice a lot for your friends, perhaps a little too much? Do you feel that you would go to the depths of the oceans for your friends? The positive side of this is that you are able to form deep and abiding friendships. You may even travel on ocean holidays with friends, share fun times at the beach or join a marine group. On the other hand you may be a martyr to the cause of friendship. If your sacrifices are too great then you are likely to end up feeling bitter when the favours are not returned. Your lesson is to gather appreciative loving friends and colleagues, while also making sure that you nurture yourself with quality activities. You are fortunate indeed in that you are likely to gather a group of loyal and abiding friends who stand by you for life.

*Sedna in 12th House
You are the ideal person to be around in a crisis. You are deeply caring and able to respond appropriately to situations that may overwhelm other people. You are sincere, understanding and well aware that everyone has a story of hardship, and hopefully triumph, to tell. You know what it is like to journey to the edge and be forced to rely on hidden resources. The problem is who is around when you are in trouble? If you are the strong and resourceful one, when do you get to sink? This is where you need to be very careful that you are not becoming a victim of abuse, or a martyr to other people's incessant need for help. It is important with this placement of Sedna that you learn to take time to recharge your batteries without sinking into reclusivity. For instance a holiday by the ocean, a spiritual retreat or a long walk in nature can be restorative. But spending endless days isolated can be too much. You need to learn to judge your own needs, when to help others and when to switch off. This way both you, and other people, really benefit from the hidden depths of your personality - the love, joy and appreciation of the universe.

*Eris in 1st House
You are a regular Tinkerbell or Peter Pan, a natural born mischief-maker. "Who me"? you ask bemused. Yes, you, although you may not be aware of the effect that you have on those around you, particularly those close to you.  You are probably a charming, lovely person, but you just seem to leave a small trail of emotional debris where ever you go. This is not necessarily a negative trait. In fact others can appreciate the way that you disrupt their lives, adding a frisson of excitement, perhaps shaking up a monotonous routine. No one is bored when you are around. You are a catalyst, the guest who livens things up at a dinner party, or any gathering. Your lesson is to listen to the still small voice within, the one that guides you to sprinkle a little positive magic rather than the one that stirs up mental images of mayhem. You can also put this trait to good use as a member or leader of a cause or group designed to change the status quo.

*Eris in 2nd House
Are your finances constantly in disarray? Do you battle to set or maintain a budget? Do gremlins seem to pop up whenever you try to sort out your personal finances? No matter how much money you earn, or attract, you don't seem to be able to settle down and enjoy your income. This could be because just as one bill is paid another crops up, or it could be because you are not satisfied with your lot in life. You are likely to have arguments with anyone who affects your income - your boss, wife, husband, children etc. This is because your lesson is to learn to stop worrying about every little coin. Of course you need to be sensible, but you also need to remain calm. Bless every amount earned no matter how small or big. Appreciate all the lovely gifts and possessions that come your way. Learn to love the things that people give to you, even those that do not carry a monetary value. It's magic. The gremlins then stop playing with your purse strings and you can enjoy a sense of abundance.

*Eris in 3rd House
Ah that tongue of yours can get you into real strife! It is not that you mean to say the wrong thing. Rather it feels like the words just rush from your brain to your mouth without a second thought. Not all of the time, but just enough to land you in hot water. Others do not appreciate your opinions, even if you are often right, or perhaps especially because you are often right. The problem is that sometimes you are not accurate. You have not listened carefully, or perhaps you have not respected differences of attitudes or opinions. Either way, your lesson is to listen, learn and carefully state your case. Often it is not what you are saying, but rather the way that you are saying it. Temper your thoughts, and your words, with love and compassion. This way Eris, the goddess of discord, will not run havoc when you are communicating. Others will then really appreciate the way that you think outside the square. They will listen to your bright and unusual solutions to problems, and be grateful for your insights into most matters.

*Eris in 4th House
Eris the Goddess of discord is affecting your home and family. This might simply mean that you rarely seem to have a quiet family dinner at home. You may even a large, noisy family, which is always on the go. Life is rarely quiet at home. Even if you are single and living on your own, you may prefer to eat out rather than settle in for a quiet night. Your home life is hectic. You may move frequently, searching for a place to belong. You may enjoy an itinerant lifestyle, or a busy home life. If you don't then eventually you need to face a few home truths. Why can't you find a place of peace within yourself? Is something troubling you? You may have to settle an emotional account with your father, or someone significant in your early life. Alternatively if you feel that you are at peace with your past and your own feelings, then you may have to make different choices that lead to a more peaceful or simple lifestyle. 

*Eris in 5th House
You enjoy competition. Not necessarily in sports, but generally you like to test your skills in one or more areas of your life. This can cause you some strife because others may be prepared for a co-operative and creative venture while you are all set for a contest. You may also have a tendency to opt out of any game, or pastime, that does not meet your expectations. You like to win. Have you ever been accused of being a bad sport or a sore loser? On a more positive note you can enjoy spectator sports, card games that test your skills and any creative enterprise that requires initiative, drama or aggression. If you have children, or work with children, then you may encounter some trouble as they grow up, particularly if you subconsciously compete with them. Positively speaking you may enjoy teaching a form of sports, or working with troubled children. 

*Eris in 6th House
The troublemaker Eris is affecting your daily life. This means that on a daily basis you are likely to experience annoyances. These can vary from unwelcome interruptions, to more serious problems with pets and co-workers. You need to avoid irritable workmates, grumpy bosses and unstable animals. You are not necessarily doing anything consciously to upset others. It is simply that you seem to attract problems. You can turn this placement into a positive one by choosing to work in an area that demands skills in fixing problems, soothing troubled animals, saving at risk people or animals or any job that deals with calming strife. In the meantime you need to do everything that you can to stay out of trouble.

*Eris in 7th House
Have you ever heard of the slang expression "trouble and strife",  a Cockney saying meaning "wife"? Well this is a most apt saying for you. Your relationship with your spouse, wife or husband, is likely to be feisty at times. Depending on other aspects your chart you may enjoy the thrust and parry of discussions, arguments and exchanges of opinions. You are likely to develop the powers of diplomacy through first hand experience. You learn within the arena of your marriage to develop a thick skin and to stand up for yourself. You need to make sure that you commit to someone who also enjoys competition, rather than co-operation, in your union. Otherwise you may alienate your beloved through too many clashes of opinion, and other aggressive behaviour. You may enjoy competition but your partner also needs to find this stimulating rather than irritating. Occasionally this placement can indicate someone who thinks commitment is just too much trouble, preferring a series of partners or living on their own to becoming seriously involved.

*Eris in 8th House
Money, sex and religion can get you into trouble. So you are well advised to show some restraint in these areas. You may already know this, steering clear of such subjects. You also need to think twice before dabbling in any of the dark arts, or the underbelly of society. The business world can also be a bit of a minefield, but not necessarily a deterrent. In fact you may enjoy the cut and thrust nature of business, money markets and other such areas. You are a born survivor, although you can tend to leave a wake of destruction in your path. You may make an impressive counselor, as you are not afraid to tackle sticky issues. You may also have a sixth sense when it comes to trouble, using this in your personal life, or as a troubleshooter in your work.

*Eris in 9th House
You have strong opinions on most worldly matters and you are not afraid to voice them. This is one of the more fortunate positions for the troublesome Eris because your opinions are likely to be debated rather than cause hurt feelings. In fact you may enjoy joining a debating team, lecturing or tutoring in a subject that you are passionate about or taking on the role of preacher. You may travel to avoid personal or societal conflict. You are likely to be well versed in world conflict, understanding the triggers for war and perhaps taking a role in reporting on world events, studying law, or working in a diplomatic field. You need to ensure that you keep a positive, rather than pessimistic outlook on matters. If you take a course in higher education, you need to choose carefully. Otherwise you might be forced to change courses midstream. Take care not to travel to troubled areas. You may prefer to visit historical war sites, or take a seat in a famous dramatic production.

*Eris in 10th House
You need to choose a career that helps troubled people, involves conflict resolution, or troubleshooting of some description. Otherwise you may find yourself embroiled in politics at work and in your marriage. This is because the troublesome Eris is in the career and marriage sector of your birth chart. You attract trouble with a capital "T" in your profession. You are likely to land in hot water at least once in your career lifetime. The best way to avoid this is to face it head on. Why not work with it rather than against it? Therefore teaching troubled children, working as a counselor or psychologist, negotiating Trade Union deals and other such professions could be just the ticket. In some cases this placement can indicate a disturbed mother, or a difficult relationship with your mother. However, this can prompt you to study or work in an area related to your experiences. 

*Eris in 11th House
You attract the lost souls of the world. You don't mean to but somehow your friends all seem to have a sad story to tell. You probably don't realize just how susceptiable you are to stepping into the troubled waters of your friend's lives. This can be a wonderful quality, however; you also need to make sure that you can enjoy good times with your associates, rather than just the difficult ones. You also need to be wary when it comes to groups, clubs and organizations. In some ways you are better off leading a maverick life when it comes to these types of collaborations. You are too competitive and direct to be very useful in a committee-style setting. If you do join a group then you would be better advised to run for Chairman, Director or President rather than one of the committee. If you are required to work in a team then you need to be allocated specific tasks to achieve rather than joint projects. You are likely to be a fine leader, soothing over trouble waters and sorting out any conflicts that arise. However, you are less likely to succeed as one of the team members. You may join a group that fights on behalf on other people, or that is involved in helping the world to become a better place.

*Eris in 12th House
You like to keep conflict deeply buried, rather than out in the open. In fact you may live in a fantasy world, not realizing the depths of other people's feelings until they seemingly erupt from nowhere. You are not deliberately ignoring the problems, you are genuinely not aware of the trouble that surrounds you, or the matters that your loved ones are trying to communicate. This can be a wonderful trait helping you to concentrate on demanding projects, meditate and pray for long periods of time and generally contemplate the finer things in life. You are not easily distracted, which is quite an advantage in some situations. However, it can also be hurtful to yourself and your loved ones when you are genuinely unaware of the impact of your own behaviour on other people, and their problems' effects on you. So what to do? Take a deep breath and learn to be very still - not lost in your own thoughts, but becoming watchful of the true nature of those surrounding you. You may also choose to work in a healing or teaching institution at some stage in your life. Sound can be very soothing ranging from the sounds of nature through to complex musical compositions.

Rituals that open a door to comprehending the powerful cycles of the Earth are part of the gift of this placement. Druids, followers of Wicca, those who are connected to 'goddess' energy and other 'earth' types of spirituality are often associated with this Vertex.  There can be a destiny connected to animals and some birds so it is important to always treat them with kindness and respect. This destiny can include plants, particularly plants that are of service to mankind in some way, so you may find you have a wonderful 'feel' for herbs, grains, flowers and flower remedies. Science or medicine can be a strong focus for this Sign and the Vertex here will at times give considerable inspiration in your speciality.
|The  AntiVertex in Pisces will draw you to those whose needs, compassion and spiritual insights motivate you to find practical answers and healing modalities to life's dilemmas. 
|At times of important changes in your life and/or during moments of crisis those who have the Sign Virgo or the planets Mercury or Ceres strongly placed in their natal chart will give you the help, knowledge or skills you need to help you make a transition to a new awareness of reality.

*Vertex in Libra
You dream of your soul mate and the Vertex in this Sign will often draw you to relationships that give you the feeling that you were destined to meet. These relationships can last for an hour or for many years, be happy or unhappy, but you never forget them because in some way they touched your soul.  Even a business partner or a working partner can open new doors for you. At times these people can be so different to you that you wonder why you are together, but they can offer you ways of seeing the world that you never dreamed existed. If you have a scientific bent, this placement can also be connected to artificial intelligence and even robotics. You can be fascinated by the various forms of flying -from space ships to parachuting - and particularly fascinated by the people who are skilled in these areas. 
|The  AntiVertex in Aries will draw to you those whose drive and vision motivate you to follow your dream.
|At times of important changes in your life and/or during moments of crisis those who have the Sign Libra and/or the planet Venus strongly placed in their natal chart will entice you to meet new people and learn new ways of perceiving the world that completely change your understanding of life.

*Vertex in Scorpio
This is one of the most demanding placements in the Zodiac as the Sign Scorpio gives intense experiences and the Vertex axis intensifies this even further. Scorpio gives profound experiences in life and with the Vertex in this Sign these experiences will take you to its heights and depths. They can open your mind to amazing possibilities in the medical, research and scientific areas or show you the depths of human nature. Some of you will have sexual experiences that are so powerful they will open doors to feelings you had no idea existed and therefore change your whole life. The human singing voice can produce resonances that reverberate throughout your whole system and influences your moods and actions; therefore it is wise to make sure you choose voices that uplift you rather than those whose songs make you feel sad, depressed or angry. Scorpio is noted as the best healer of the Zodiac. With the Vertex here it is possible that you will have a destiny in physical, mental, emotional or spiritual areas of healing and become a powerful force in one of these fields.
|The  AntiVertex in Taurus will draw you to those whose stability and commonsense anchor you and who's steadying influence enables you to safely dive into the deeper areas of life.
|At times of important changes in your life and/or during moments of crisis those who have the Sign Scorpio and/or the planets Mars or Pluto emphasised in their natal chart will demand you have the courage to tackle powerful issues that lead to a complete transformation.

*Vertex in Sagittarius
You are the most insatiable explorer in the whole Zodiac. Unless you have been traumatized as a child, travel and/or contact with those in other lands and faraway places are as necessary to you as breathing.  As the Vertex is the doorway to other realities, people with this placement can take travel up a notch. Many of you will astral travel at least once in your lifetime and quite a few regularly use this skill. Remote viewing is another form of exploration that you find enticing. You can't resist being able to psychically see people and places in the world that you can never physically visit. Proper training in this area is essential and fortunately for you, now readily available. You will find you are drawn to a country different to that of your birth. You have a destiny connected to a person born there, or the land itself and its cultures, past or present.  You may live in this country for many years or even make it your permanent residence. You may enjoy mental exploration as much as physical. You take great delight in exploring the great minds of the past; their thoughts open your own mind to quite different types of cultures and different modes of living. As a result you can develop considerable expertise connected to religions and/or philosophies. 
|The  AntiVertex in Gemini will draw you to those whose tales and stories stimulate your imagination and motivate you to further explore. These people will be able to help you record your adventures and insights as well as introduce you to people and places you find fascinating.
|At times of important changes in your life and/or during times of crisis you will be drawn to those who have the Sign Sagittarius and/or the planet Jupiter strongly placed in their natal chart. These people will protect you and guide you through your difficulties.  Their abilities stimulate you to greater awareness and motivate you to develop skills in their area of expertise.

*Vertex in Capricorn
The symbol for Capricorn is the Goat with the tail of a fish. This symbol indicates that Capricorn has a spiritual and esoteric quality. As the Vertex is the doorway to other realities, it is very likely to access this quality when in this Sign. Capricorn builds the structures of civilisations, cultures, societies and organisations and your destiny is to be a part of this in some way. You will find that you are almost magically drawn to the people, places or situations where your skill can help build permanent foundations. At times you will find that information about an ancient culture can have a profound effect. You will want to learn all you can about this period of time and the information you glean can be applied to the present - often with a bit of a twist to fit modern ways. Crystals 'speak' to you. You have an instinctive understanding of their energy and how to apply it. You may become skilled with precious gems or have an extensive knowledge of how crystals can be used to align the energy centres of the body. Those more scientifically oriented develop an understanding of how to use crystals in useful way - for example, to power machinery. Capricorn is connected to the 'bones' of the Earth so at crucial times you can be drawn to rocks, minerals, mountains or caves for a mystical purpose. During these periods you will feel the need to withdraw from society for a while to re-energise. Proper physical alignment is important for you as this gives you the ability to access the mysteries of life and death.  You will benefit from an understanding of the chakras and the proper alignment of the spine and bones of the body. For this reason Hatha Yoga and spiritual forms of Yoga are of particular benefit to you.
|The  AntiVertex in Cancer will draw you to those who nurture and care for you as you put your full attention into your destined area of life. They will help you present your abilities to the public in an attractive and enticing way.
|At times of important changes in your life and/or at times of crisis you will meet people who have the Sign Capricorn or the planet Saturn strongly placed in their natal chart. These people will help you plan for the future and enable you to build new structures on the bones of the old.

*Vertex in Aquarius
Technology is just catching up to Aquarius, so for some the area of destiny has yet to be invented or has only just been invented. You have a strong social conscience and your destiny lies in areas that benefit people and/or the structures of society. You can freely give your time, expertise, inventions and even money if you feel this will benefit an individual, group or culture. You have the ability to see a situation from quite a different perspective and persuade others to see things in the same light.  Whether your choice of career is writing, music, science, invention, the social work areas or just ordinary day to day work, your input will always be original with a slant that brings new possibilities to that area.  You can have a profound influence on others. This Vertex brings a great interest in the mysteries of the universe that take you beyond ordinary life. Astrology, astronomy, science, physics , studying the very ancient past or using your imagination to project into the future are all possible venues for your quest for answers. Outer space, intelligent life on other planets and even the intelligence of other species on Earth are all areas of interest that if developed, can greatly contribute to human understanding. You can have a profound connection to birds which fly very high or fly very long distances. You may have an affinity with electricity and other forms of energy and, if you have scientific mind, may be involved in finding alternative forms of energy to power our planet, or on a smaller scale, your home or vehicle. Alternatively you may find you are drawn to the 'virtual reality' areas and your skilful imagination can find ways to make this seem very real.
|The  AntiVertex in Leo will draw you to those who have the flair and pizzazz to present your work to the world and motivate you to continue even when you feel discouraged. 
|At times of important changes in your life and/or at times of crisis you will meet people who have the Sign Aquarius and/or the planets Uranus or Saturn strongly placed in their natal chart. These people will be able to grasp your ideas and support you in your endeavours.

*Vertex in Pisces
You have the ability to soar above the trees and see the whole forest. This is very useful in any area that requires imagination, inspiration or even technical expertise.  This is the Vertex of compassion. You are so aware of the gamut of human emotion and are developing comprehension of how this all fits together to create a whole. You lose the need to judge another as you can see behind the facade to their soul. These abilities can be used in many areas. Directing films is a talent that you may possess, even if it is only home movies. Music as an art that heals the soul resonates with you. As politics requires the ability to be able to serve large populations as well as attend to the needs of smaller groups with that population, it is very suited to this Vertex. You may prefer a quieter, more private life and if so this placement will draw you to meditation, spiritual contemplation and sometimes seclusion. You might find the life of a contemplative monk, nun or recluse appealing as it gives you the privacy to explore your inner being and develop wisdom. At times you need the wide open spaces - the night sky, the vast ocean, the wide desert - to give you a feeling of infinity. You wish to soar, to lose yourself in the universe, to blend with god and feel the ecstasy of this experience.  Psychic abilities interest you a great deal and you may develop those that require empathy, especially diagnostic skills developed through being able to determine where there is a problem by touching a person or object or feeling their energy field.
|The  AntiVertex in Virgo will draw you to those whose practical mind and technical skills complement your abilities. These people are able to organise the tools and people you need to fulfil your purpose.
|At times of important changes in your life and/or at times of crisis you will meet people who have the Sign Pisces or the planets Neptune or Jupiter strongly placed in their natal chart. These people will give you the inspiration, compassion and understanding to motivate you to move into a higher level of universal awareness.

*BlackMoon in Aries
The Black Moon is in the fiery Sign of Aries indicating that you may not be aware of the impact of your behaviour on those around you. You may feel that others are overly asserting their rights and that you are not having a fair say. In fact it is probably the other way around. You are not realising the extent to which you are asserting yourself. You may be quite passive aggressive in getting your own way. Even as you read this you are likely to be denying the truth of this interpretation, ready to skip through. The planet Mars is said to rule the sign of Aries. Therefore you need to look at this planet in your Horoscope and claim your independence in a positive manner. Once you realise just how powerful you are, then you no longer feel the need to overcompensate by forcing your way. The BlackMoon's gift is the opportunity to bring unconscious or self-defeating behaviour into the light of day where it can no longer run amok.

*BlackMoon in Taurus
The Black Moon is in the earthbound sign of Taurus indicating that you may resist positive changes in your life through a stubborn refusal to move out of your comfort zone. Of course you may blame those closest to you, believing that they have not provided a viable way forward. However, it is actually your resistance that is proving the problem. In some cases there is never going to be enough money, satisfactory security or practical plans. You just have to take a risk. Once you have faced the fact that you are the one providing the obstacles then you may be able to take some practical steps towards achieving your goals, and helping support your loved ones. The positive Planet Venus rules the Sign of Taurus and therefore you are likely to be provided for sufficiently if you accept your limitations and don't impose them on others.

*BlackMoon in Gemini
The Black Moon is in the Air Sign of Gemini in your birth chart indicating that you have a real gift for communication, however; you don't always use it to the best of your ability. This is because you try to talk other people around to your way of thinking, rather than listening to their thoughts and opinions. You probably think that it is the other way around, that people in your vicinity fail to listen to you. You just don't realise how often you need to have the last word or how frustrating this can be to those closest to you. You need to learn to listen and respect other people's points of view and incorporate them into your modus operandi. At some stage you may learn the hard way, when someone actually walks away refusing to argue any longer. However, it is also possible that you persist in believing that this is their refusal to compromise, not your own. The Black Moon's gift is the opportunity to bring unconscious or self-defeating behaviour into the light of day where it can no longer run amok. Therefore once you can listen and learn, you are likely to be a powerful negotiator. You can earn the respect of others and perhaps even excel in negotiating business deals, relationship mediation, and conflict resolution.

*BlackMoon in Cancer
The Black Moon Lilith is in the Water Sign of Cancer in your birth chart indicating that you have a tendency to be emotionally manipulative. You may think that it is your loved ones who are the moody ones, but this is not always the case. When you are upset you sulk, withdrawing your love and turning away from further communications. You are like your Horoscope symbol the crab in that you retreat. You believe that other people have withdrawn their love and approval, but you need to face the fact that you do not deal very well with your own hurt feelings. Your insecurities may be ruining your chances at loving relationships. Once you realise that you can change the way that you respond to your own and other people's feelings, then you are free to connect with others at a deep and fulfilling level. The Moon is said to rule the Sign of Cancer, which means that your needs can be met once you have faced a few home truths.

*BlackMoon in Leo
The Black Moon is in the fiery Sign of Leo in your birth chart indicating that you sometimes believe that other people are taking advantage of your good nature. You believe that you give, give, give and get little in return. In fact you might not be aware of just how much others are doing for you. In fact it is highly possible that you are the one who is taking, taking, taking and not acknowledging the support that you actually receive. The positive thing side of Leo is honesty. You know these traits exist and that you need to address them and you will do so. You need to acknowledge your need to shine, the support that others offer you and the gratitude that you truly feel. Once you have done this then you are able to give back. The Black Moon's gift is the opportunity to bring unconscious or self-defeating behaviour into the light of day where it can no longer run amok. So you have the opportunity to achieve great things in co-operation with other people, either your loved ones close to home or co-workers in society.

*BlackMoon in Virgo
The Black Moon is in the precise and practical Earth Sign of Virgo indicating that you believe that you are always having to live up to other people's high standards. You feel that others demand perfection which means that you are doomed to fail. In fact it is you who sets the standards. Unwittingly you are pushing yourself too hard, and also driving those around you to live up to your expectations. It is a vicous circle. You are indeed destined to fail if you are always raising the bar, never fully appreciating your own and other people's gifts. Once you have realised that you are driven in certain areas of your life, then you can start to relax the rules. You are perceptive. So once you have acknowledged your own shortcomings, as a need for perfection is indeed a shortcoming, then you are able to see the light. You can lighten your own load, as well as other people's. You may even see the humour in such situations, and help others laugh with your gift for analysis and perception.

*BlackMoon in Libra
Do you have a propensity to procrastinate? Do you spend too much time gossiping rather than getting on with your own business? And do you get entangled in other people's business? If the answers to any of these questions are "yes" then this is likely to be the Black Moon influencing your birth chart. Your Black Moon is in the sign of Libra indicating that you are often focussed on other people's affairs rather than your own. An offshoot of this trait can be that you never have enough money. This is because of your lack of focus on your own business and the fact that you don't want to upset other people. You are a people-pleaser. The Black Moon's gift is the opportunity to bring unconscious or self-defeating behaviour into the light of day where it can no longer run amok. Therefore you move forward rapidly on your own life's journey once you learn to assert yourself, and focus on matters at hand.

*BlackMoon in Scorpio
Do you feel that you are often embroiled in other people's emotional dramas? The Black Moon is in the intense Sign of Scorpio in your birth chart indicating that you often feel that other people invade your life with their crises. You sometimes crave solitude and resent their intrusion. Perhaps you don't realise the extent to which you are attracted to these dramas. You feel a little more alive and connected to other people when sharing intense moments. Therefore you need to accept your own need for emotional intensity. You may even decide to opt for work that demands intense concentration, or some form of counselling.

*BlackMoon in Sagittarius
You have a tendency to throw yourself into new ventures, determined to be exhilarated physically, emotionally or mentally. This can be a positive trait if you show some self-restraint and consider those around you. However, the Black Moon in the Sign of Sagittarius indicates that you are somewhat reckless in pursuit of your goals. Imagine a team of horses galloping out of control with a carriage bouncing around behind them. Ask some of the people close to you if they can perhaps identify with this imagery. Do they feel as if you are the team of horses and they are riding in an out-of-control carriage? You might be surprised by their answers. You don't fully realise how the exuberant side of your nature takes over. You don't mean to bully your loved ones and colleagues, but this can be the effect if you are not careful. This sensitive point represents the darker side of your nature, characteristics you know exist and need to address, but prefer not to acknowledge. The Black Moon's gift is the opportunity to bring unconscious or self-defeating behaviour into the light of day where it can no longer run amok. Therefore once you recognise the need to temper your enthusiasm, and to give others the freedom to express their own passion, then you have the makings of an effective teacher or leader.

*BlackMoon in Capricorn
You like to be in charge. There is nothing wrong with this trait. In fact it means that you are often willing to take responsibility when others are not. However, the problem comes in that you don't recognise when the need to let go. You don't mean to impose your will on other people. At one level you may believe that you can do a better job, or perhaps you think that you are the only one available. You may not be conscious of excluding other people, but you do. Sooner or later those around you are likely to resent your need for control. The Black Moon represents the darker side of your nature, characteristics you know exist and need to address, but prefer not to acknowledge. This sensitive point is in the serious Sign of Capricorn in your birth chart. Hence your need to be in charge - of everything! You may think that others are trying to tell you what to do, but they are most likely simply trying to help you loosen up a little. You need to face the fact that your sense of duty is self-defeating. Once you can let go, and let others have a say and assist, then you are likely to feel much better. Your strength is accentuated as you learn to be more flexible.

*BlackMoon in Aquarius
Friendships are a little fraught in your lifetime. You may feel that your friends fail to live up to your expectations, that you cannot count on them, or perhaps that they don't listen. The Black Moon is in the Air Sign of Aquarius in your birth chart indicating that you like to be part of a group, to be connected to like-minded friends and to socialise. However, you often feel rejected and you believe that it is others who are rejecting you. In fact the opposite is likely to be true. You may not realise that you are quite fixed in your ideas, or that you are imposing your thoughts and feelings on others expecting them to agree with you. Any sign of disagreement is viewed as a lack of support. It is this and your inability to accept differences in your friends that triggers any social problems that you may encounter. Of course, you can join a group with similar ideals, but sooner or later individuals within this group are likely to hold different opinions and values. You need to learn to face your own intolerance. If you can learn to agree to disagree then you are likely to enjoy connections with other people from all walks of life. Your social life, and any work with groups, is more enjoyable when you learn to be flexible in your attitude.

*BlackMoon in Pisces
What a sensitive soul you are. The trouble with this placement of the Black Moon in the Sign of Pisces is that you don't fully accept the emotional side of your nature. You shy away from deep connections with other people believing that they are too unstable, or conversely not logical enough for you. What you may not realise is that you are not being rational. What you think is true of other people is actually true of you. Believe it or not you are the sensitive one, reacting through your feelings rather than applying reason. You need to accept this part of your nature so that you can then truly connect with other human beings. This sensitive point represents the darker side of your nature, characteristics you know exist and need to address, but prefer not to acknowledge. The Black Moon's gift is the opportunity to bring unconscious or self-defeating behaviour into the light of day where it can no longer run amok. So whenever you behave in a critical manner, stop. Think about it. Are you hurting someone else's feelings? Are your feelings hurt? Take a deep breath and plunge into the world of emotions. You may be surprised by the depth of your own feelings, and the rewards that come with letting go.

*AntiVertex in Aries
You dream of your soul mate and the Vertex in this Sign will often draw you to relationships that give you the feeling that you were destined to meet. These relationships can last for an hour or for many years, be happy or unhappy, but you never forget them because in some way they touched your soul.  Even a business partner or a working partner can open new doors for you. At times these people can be so different to you that you wonder why you are together, but they can offer you ways of seeing the world that you never dreamed existed.

You can be fascinated by the various forms of flying -from space ships to parachuting - and particularly fascinated by the people who are skilled in these areas. 
|The  AntiVertex in Aries will draw to you those whose drive and vision motivate you to follow your dream.
|At times of important changes in your life and/or during moments of crisis those who have the Sign Libra and/or the planet Venus strongly placed in their natal chart will entice you to meet new people and learn new ways of perceiving the world that completely change your understanding of life.

You can be persuasive, dynamic and an excellent motivator for others who are interested in the same area. You will develop an intensity of focussed skill in your vocation.

These pursuits can give you the ability to lose yourself in the energies of the universe and return vitalised and refreshed. You may have a destiny connected to birds. It is important that you are always kind and loving to these creatures of the air.

*AntiVertex in Capricorn
This will give you a magic touch with the public. You easily understand how to manipulate emotions and are highly responsive to the public mood. Unless other placements negate this, the public will instinctively love you and respond to whatever you offer. Your ability to feel the emotional flow in your world will continuously increase empathy. This can be a two edged sword as at times it can be quite painful to be aware of the sadder or darker emotions of human-kind. As a result you will need to periodically withdraw and become exceedingly private - you will want to completely shut the doors to the outer world. These private times can give you access to very deep insights that increase your compassion and wisdom.   If other parts of the natal chart concur, the Vertex in this Sign can give mediumship abilities. You have a connection to the sea, rivers and lakes that is deep and often magical - if King Arthur of the Round Table had been a real person he would have had the Vertex in Cancer!

*AntiVertex in Aquarius
Fame of some kind is yours. It is often thrust upon you quite unexpectedly and lasts for quite a while. It is important to embrace the fame rather than resist it as it is part of your destiny. The Vertex in Leo gives an ability to be noticed and loved that outshines any other - even the Ascendant or MC in Leo bows to this placement. People are drawn to you like a magnet and will happily do all they can to honour you and help you if needed. Love is your doorway to enlightenment and you can both give and receive love in abundance. For this reason it is wise to never abuse or neglect those who love you as this will diminish the power and beauty of the Vertex in this Sign. Part of your destiny is connected to children, either your own or those you are able to help in some way. Their innocence, energy and love of life stimulate you to greater heights of awareness and increase your own ability to shine. When you feel the joy of life you are intensely creative and often achieve fame through a creative area. If you find the joy of life is diminishing, then play with those who love life and this will replenish you.  As you have a strong sense of drama the theatre fascinates you and many of you find your destiny in this field.

You are drawn to unusual people. Positively these people may be spiritual and artistic, or negatively they may be confused and drunk. You may idealise other people and need to be more realistic. The conflict is that you want to be at-one with the universe and yet cannot be until you have a clear idea of your identity. The lesson is to recognise your own artistic and spiritual potential.

*Moon Opposition Pluto
Conflict arises in your life through your relationships with dramatic and intense individuals. As a child you may have experience intense conflict with a parent figure, probably mother. As an adult, you experience a love-hate element in your relationships which is a reflection of how you feel about yourself. You need to accept change in your life and channel the intensity into a suitable creative project.

*Moon Opposition Chiron
Within you exists a deep emotional pain stemming originally from your relationship with your mother. You attract partners and situations which reflect that pain. It may be that your partner needs much caring or it may be that your partner sparks your wounds. The lesson is to face the pain and learn to balance your needs with the needs of others. You may then become a wise and loving healer.

*Moon Opposition Vesta
Vesta is the Goddess associated with the sacred matters related to everyday functions. She depicts the rituals of work and wellbeing. When combined with your Moon in this manner it suggests that you have some difficulty reconciling your need for routine and your other emotional needs. You need to find a balance, seeking daily activities that provide emotional sustenance. This Goddess is calling on you to express your feelings through rituals, to calm your emotions through daily practices such as yoga and/or meditation and to treat your body as a temple.

*Moon Opposition Juno
Relationships with loved ones provide you with emotional sustenance. Therefore you are likely to be nurtured, and to nurture your loved ones through food, get-togethers and general conviviality. However, you need to ensure that your loved ones are on the same wave length. For instance do your loved ones know of your need for nurturing through shared sustenance? Are you giving more than you receive? As one astrologer once said, "Juno is the Nigella Lawson of the Zodiac".  This is because Juno is the domestic Goddess of the Zodiac. When combining with your Moon she highlights your need for domestic warmth, harmony and nurturing. You simply need to ensure that you are nurturing yourself as much as you are looking after others. Over-indulgence is likely to lead to emotional and physical problems. If you can strike the right balance then you are likely to eat, drink and be merry with your loved ones.

*Moon Opposition Ceres
Relationships with women do not flow as easily as you would like in your life. Perhaps you feel that you are misunderstood by the women who are closest to you, or maybe you don't fully understand their emotions. As a result you are on a path of integrating your own emotions. This means that you need to nurture and accept the feminine aspects of your own nature. As a result your understanding of women grows and your sense of loss lessens.

*Moon Opposition NorthNode
You are a sensitive person with a tendency to learn from experience rather through books. Experience teaches you to harness your emotions for the betterment of your own life's journey, and for those around you. However, you also have to let go of part hurts and grudges before you can truly move towards your destiny. This lifetime you have the opportunity to forgive and forget. As you do this you will see clear signposts as to how to move closer to your goals. Doors open. People appear. Opportunities arise. You need only have the courage to embrace them.

*Moon Opposition SouthNode
Your feelings are your compass in life. Your intuition is strong and you are being urged to come to terms with this emotional and intuitional side of your nature. When young you may have difficulty expressing your emotions, particularly in groups of people. However, this is an area in which you grow until you can freely express your intuitional nature in a new way. The more that you follow your heart, and ensure that your feelings are true the greater good you perform for yourself and those around you.

*Moon Opposition Ascendant
You need to be needed by your loved ones. You seek close emotional bonds with those nearest and dearest and find it difficult to spend time on your own. Marriage, or a partnerships, is something that you yearn for and yet sometimes seems elusive. Ironically the more that you can satisfy your own emotional needs, the more that you are likely to attract the close emotional bond that you so eagerly seek.

*Moon Opposition Midheaven
Most people are influenced by their home and family. However, you are particularly sensitive to the ebb and flow of family life. As a young child you enjoy spending time in your home, relating to those who share your household as well as extended family members. If you grow up in a warm and supportive family environment then you are likely to enjoy an equally happy household as an adult. If you suffer at the hands of your family then your journey may be rockier. At some stage you are likely to break away, determined to create a sense of security in your own home. You may start a family of your own with the view of developing a warm and safe household. Safety and security at home are vital factors for your health and happiness. You need a safe haven. Your home does not necessarily need to be a large mansion, but you do need to feel comfortable. You are likely to be a force to be reckoned with in your family life. Other family members may come and go, but you are the one likely to be a guiding hand and a comfort for family members. You may be the keeper of family memories with photographic displays, books, and stories to tell. The family history fascinates you, perhaps even compelling you to research and record facts and stories.

*Moon Opposition PartofFortune
Good fortune is likely to feature in your life, particularly in connection with women but only after you have oversome some adversity in life. You need to build your self-esteem. When your self-esteem is strong and you are feeling stable then you can attract wealth, health and happiness, particularly through your relationships with women. However, if you are feeling upset, lost or lonely then you may be tempted to compromise your good fortune. You need to ensure that you remain at peace with your own emotions and all will be well.

*Moon Opposition Imum Coeli
This is a prominent placement for the Moon indicating that you have a strong inclination to find your purpose in life and express it through your career or through parenthood. Your emotions are likely to affect your choice of career. Therefore you need to make sure that you strike out on your own journey rather than trying to please one or both of your parents. You also need to ensure that you like and respect anyone who holds authority in your chosen profession. Otherwise you may feel uncomfortable at work. You are likely to crave recognition for your achievements. This may come in the form of praise from your colleagues or bosses, or if you receive awards in your industry. You are sensitive about your role in public, and seek a sense of security from your chosen profession. The more that you feel that you are steering your life in the right direction the more happy you are likely to be in all areas. In the same way that you feel comforted when your career is stable, you may also comfort others through your chosen profession. Perhaps you enjoy looking after your workmates, listening to their troubles and bringing them little treats, or maybe your career is in a helping profession, or the hospitality industry. Your life choices may be strongly influenced from childhood through to adulthood by your mother, or another matriach in your family.

However you may also be a well-balanced individual who enjoys the company of both men and women, and knows how to relate to others in a positive and nurturing manner. This combination can also indicate that you benefit from escaping the rigours of a material world for sojourns into nature. You can rejuvenate your spirit through communing with the natural world. Beauty, peace and love are important to you.

*Sun Conjunction NorthNode
It is time for you to leave behind your past inhibitions and truly express yourself in this life-time.

This is a prominent placement of the Sun indicating that you are keen to make your mark on the world. You want to leave a legacy whether through your chosen profession, an official position in a group or club, or your children. You like to shine in the public eye. This could literally mean that you choose a career that propels you into the limelight such acting, singing, politics or teaching. However, it could simply mean that you are ambitious, keen to make it to the top in any field. Your reputation is important. This is a fortunate position of the Sun. Therefore you are likely to receive support enabling you to achieve your life ambitions. Others are happy to see you have your moment, or moments, in the sun. You need only set your goals, pace yourself and shine. As US General S Patton once said: "I do not fear failure. I only fear the 'slowing up' of the engine inside of me which is pounding, saying, 'Keep going, someone must be on top, why not you?'"

Your joy, happiness and success is associated with the true expression of your Sun Sign. You need to fully examine the Zodiac Sign of your Sun to fully understand where joy and happiness lie for you. You can truly shine when expressing your Sun Sign traits.

*Sun Conjunction Imum Coeli
Your identity is intricately linked with your family. As a young child your family, in particular your father, played a prominent role in influencing your personality, decisions, values and all facets of your life. Depending on other aspects of your birth chart this could have been a positive or negative experience. Either way you see yourself as part of a family system. Whereas friends and colleagues may have struck out on their own path early in life, you are more likely to have stayed close to home and hearth. Even if you moved out of the family home, it is likely that you stayed in the neighbourhood or in close touch with family members. Quite simply family is of utmost importance in your life. All that you achieve is likely to be as a direct result of the positive, and perhaps negative, influences of your experiences growing up in the family home. As an adult you are likely to find a home and start a family of your own, as this is more important to you than establishing a career, travelling, or other such public adventures. You may be a private person, preferring to gather a few close friends or family members in your own home. Even if you enjoy social and professional forays you are still likely to require a safe haven - your home. You are likely to shine at any family occasion, and may prefer to work from home or be the household manager.

If you have other difficult influences then you may need to be a little cautious before choosing a marriage partner. Nevertheless a wise choice can boost your coffers and your self-esteem.

Your home and hearth are sources of comfort for your loved ones. You may have a unique artistic talent, but it is more likely that your talent is for forming lasting and meaningful relationships.

*Venus Sextile Juno
This combination means that you are likely to love passionately and earnestly.  As American actress Mae West once said: "A woman in love can't be reasonable - or she probably wouldn't be in love." This is true for both men and women. Your ardour is strong once aroused. Even when you are not in love with one person, you nurture your relationships with loved ones, and possibly also with money. Those around you know that you have an impact wherever you go. Relationships are likely to be a priority in your life.

*Venus Sextile Ceres
When the planet of love Venus combines with Ceres in a harmonious way then your ability to express love and affection is in sync with your nurturing nature. This means that you have a great deal of love and compassion for anyone with whom you are in relationship. Peace, beauty and love feature in your life. You need to make sure that you are not giving more than you receive, as you find it so easy to understand and show compassion to others, particularly your female friends and your lover/s. Make sure that you enjoy social gatherings, sojourns into nature and personal beauty treatments. These nurture your soul.

You have a tendency to go where angels fear to tread, as you approach life with gusto regardless of the consequences. Travel and religious causes are likely to feature in your life. You may like to consider a career in the military or competitive sports.

*Mars Conjunction Saturn
You sometimes feel that it is hard to express your energy fully, that something always holds you back. There is a feeling of "bashing your head against a brick wall" and this is frustrating. You are ambitious, and have the ability to slowly but surely reach your goals. You also have the ability to organise yourself and others, and good self discipline.

*Mars Conjunction Uranus
You feel the need to express your energy level by taking chances. You are attracted to dangerous sports. You need to learn self discipline by directing that energy into constructive outlets. You have great courage.

*Mars Conjunction Neptune
Your enthusiasm can lack boundaries and you need to learn self discipline. You need to avoid addictive behaviour and would be better to avoid alcohol or drugs. You need to be able to escape into art, or water. Use your energy to create or to enjoy pursuits such as water sports.

*Mars Conjunction Pluto
You are resourceful and have a pool of enormous energy available when needed. You also have strong desires and a volcanic temper.

*Mars Conjunction Chiron
Your personal desires always seem to be thwarted. As a small child, you may have experienced difficulty in getting your own way in your own home. Later, as an adult, it may have seemed that the world was conspiring against you. Your lesson is to focus on the needs of the world, rather than personal desires. Once this concept is learnt, you will be a powerful advocate for humanity. You will be able to empathise with and fight for those who need your strength and compassion.

*Mars Conjunction Vesta
When you have this combination you need to ensure that you discover what lights your fire and never let the passion fade. Sexuality may be a matter of sacred communication as far as you are concerned. In fact this combination can indicate celibacy, because you are focused on other matters. You may suppress your sexual urges, happy with your own company and with concentrating your energy on inspirational projects. You are destined to direct your energies into something sacred, an activity, project or profession that inspires others. A woman, or group of women, may provide you with the encouragement that you need, but you also need to fan the flames.

*Mars Conjunction Pallas
Adventure is likely to have an influence on your relationships. This can mean that you are an independent person who needs an equally independent partner or that you need plenty of freedom to assert yourself in partnerships. You are likely to be assertive in your partnerships, unafraid of confrontation. You may venture into relationships that are not conducive to your own wellbeing and safety. Therefore you need to carefully vet any potentional partner. Also even though you do not fear conflict, you would be well advised to avoid it where possible. Issues of equality, fidelity and traditional roles within relationships are important to you.

*Mars Conjunction NorthNode
You are being challenged to become assertive and focussed on your personal goals. Independence and self-confidence are keys to your growth in this life. You may find yourself thrust into leadership roles.

*Mars Conjunction SouthNode
You are a compulsive person, liable to act before you think. This can lead you into hot water, particularly when you act independently without taking other people into consideration. One of your life lessons is to curb this compulsive behaviour, to think before you act and to find a way to express your own goals positively and co-operatively. You do have a stubborn streak which may have served you well at some time in your early life, but it does not augur well for adult relationships. Like an only child who is accustomed to getting all that he or she wants in life, you need to remind yourself of the rights of others. This will encourage your talent for independent action while also auguring well for co-operative and supportive interactions.  Assertion not agression is the key to your success.

*Mars Conjunction Ascendant
You are an active and energetic person, with plenty of spontaneity and drive to express your individuality. You may sometimes be a little blunt and straightforward.

*Mars Conjunction Midheaven
Self-confidence plays a vital role in how you handle your professional life.

You set your goals, work steadily towards achieving them and then enjoy your success in any chosen profession. Of course sports, politics, and law may feature. On the other hand if you lack self-confidence then you may falter in your chosen career. You may start with the very best of intentions, setting your goals and moving forward. However, any obstacles or conflict may upset your course. As a result you could suffer from stress-related illnesses at the sign of any professional setback.  You may also make rash decisions which adversely affect your advancement in life. If this is the case then you need to seek professional advice either through personal counseling, vocational guidance or some other such course of action that helps you build your esteem, make wise choices and achieve the success that you so desire. The prominent placement of the planet Mars does indicate that success is within your reach if you can learn how to grasp and enjoy.

*Mars Conjunction Imum Coeli
The placement of the energetic planet Mars in the home and family section of your birth chart indicates that you had a lively upbringing. This could have been a stimulating and enjoyable experience, or you could have suffered as a result of strife and trouble. Perhaps it was a little of both. As a result of your childhood experiences you are likely to find it a little difficult to settle in one place in early adulthood. Positively speaking this could lead to some real adventures as you travel far afield seeking new experiences. You learn from your experiences. Once you have chosen one place in which to nest, then you need plenty of activity within your house. You may share with many people, or perhaps you could develop some robust home activities such as renovation projects or a home gym. You need an outlet for your boundless energy, as well as a respect for the fact that other household members may require a quieter existence. If you are bored you can be quite the agitator, annoying those around you. Therefore some home activities that demand your energy can be therapeutic for everyone.

*Mars Square Moon
You are quick-tempered and intolerant. Your impatience and irritability can mean periods of loneliness when others leave you alone. Once you have learnt self- control you will discover plenty of energy to be channelled into your activities.

You have difficulty concentrating as you have so many thoughts and ideas. You are talkative but lose sight of the essence of the conversation.

You may have some difficulty being patient with loved ones. You can be aggressive and irritable when others fail to keep up with your activities. You can be equally impatient with yourself.

*Mars Square Jupiter
You need to spend a lot of time developing self discipline as your impulsiveness may be an impediment to reaching your goals.

*Mars Square Saturn
You feel a contradiction inside you between wanting to push yourself forward and a part which holds you back. You will spend a lot of time developing a controlled energy level and because of this you can eventually achieve great success.

*Mars Square Uranus
You feel the need to get your enormous energy level under some control and can eventually develop self restraint. This makes you valuable as a leader, usually in a career where your level of courage is appreciated. It will not be in a mundane area. You can be at times accident prone.

*Mars Square Neptune
You have the ability to develop great creative power but you need to avoid drugs and alcohol. You may have allergies to drugs or have food intolerances.

*Mars Square Pluto
You feel intensely and need to be able to control your emotions or you may attract violence. Learn to back off and realise that others do not feel as intensely as you do.

*Mars Square Chiron
You have difficulty being assertive. You fear that your requests will be met with anger, or you may fear your own anger. You may have a short fuse as you are easily hurt. You need to develop a strong sense of self worth and learn to honor your own way of doing things. You may also need to reassess your personal desires.

*Mars Square Midheaven
You have much energy for your chosen profession. You are ambitious, and possibly competitive in your field. Sports may feature.

*Mars Opposition Mercury
You are aggressive in your communications and are surprised when others take offence. You believe that others are criticising you when it is you who need to learn compromise.

*Mars Opposition Venus
You struggle to balance your own needs and the needs of your partners in relationships. You see-saw between wanting closeness and freedom. On the one hand you seek adventure on your own, on the other you want to be close to your partner. The ideal is a balance between the two.

*Mars Opposition Jupiter
You feel a pull between your drive to achieve and a need to enjoy yourself. You need to develop self discipline and to curb your impatience.

*Mars Opposition Saturn
You are pulled between expressing your energy and holding it back. Sometimes you are assertive and other times you can't be bothered. This may stem from your childhood when a father figure restricted your independence. Your goal is to blend the two energies so that you can then achieve success from self discipline.

*Mars Opposition Uranus
You enjoy the excitement of conflict and challenge. You can be arrogant or charming and do well in selling. Be careful with dangerous sports as you can be accident prone.

*Mars Opposition Neptune
You can be drawn between your assertive self and the side which wants to dream. Learn to integrate the two sides and you will be very creative.

*Mars Opposition Pluto
You feel intensely and need to learn balance. Get those strong feelings under control to avoid attracting violence.

*Mars Opposition Chiron
You are your own worst enemy. You struggle to be powerful and assertive, but your path to success is strewn with strife. This may have started early in life when your home felt more like a battlefield than a safe haven leaving you feeling powerless and ineffective. Now it appears that other people are opposed to your achievements. What you don't realise is that you are subconsciously sabotaging your own success. You need to honor your own and other people's worth. You may find that the battle then becomes one which you lead for those who need your empathy and help.

*Mars Opposition Vesta
Do you respect women? Do you hold them in sacred regard? If not then you are likely to face some obstacles in your life. This combination of the fiery planet Mars and the sacred Goddess Vesta indicates that you need to respect your own health and wellbeing and other people's, in particular women. You also need to ensure that you discover what lights your fire and never let the passion fade. Sexuality may be another challenge in your life. You need to develop a reverence for sexual communications. If sex is too hot to handle then you may need to retreat for periods of time, to gather your own creative fires and boundaries.  You are destined to direct your energies into something sacred, an activity, project or profession that inspires others. A woman, or group of women, may provide you with the encouragement that you need, but you also need to fan the flames yourself without resorting to aggression.

*Mars Opposition Pallas
The planet Mars can indicate a feisty and independent nature. When combined with the domestic and relationship-oriented Juno it can also indicate conflict in personal relationships. Your own personal needs for independence conflict at times with the needs of your loved ones. It is up to you to try to balance these two opposing forces if you want to enter into an intimate union. Of course you may choose your own independent path, rather than a domestic shared arrangement.

*Mars Opposition NorthNode
You are a compulsive person, liable to act before you think. This can lead you into hot water, particularly when you act independently without taking other people into consideration.

You love to experiment and can be wilful in your pursuit of stimulating and brilliant new ways and ideas.  You can be self-centred, detached, and intolerant when it comes to dealing with other people. Your task is to creatively incorporate your individuality into your life and to develop compassion for other people.

From a young age you may have questioned the imbalances within the global community. You feel motivated to help others, to perhaps raise the consciousness of other people. You may have strong spiritual convictions. These are unlikely to be conventional. Other people may consult you for guidance.

*Uranus Conjunction Juno
You are a unique individual but the domestic Goddess is unlikely to be a strong part of your daily life. In other words you are more of a free spirit than a homemaker.This combination can indicate that your spirit of independence is at odds with your domestic life.

The more that you try to ignore the rebellious side of your nature the more erratic your behaviour is likely to become. Your lesson is to learn to integrate your need for autonomy with your need to work in society. You are destined to work with groups, or in a unique manner, but in a co-operative way rather than with conflict. You are a true individual, but all individuals need to exist in a community.

*Uranus Conjunction Ascendant
You are certainly one of a kind. You may not realise just how readily others see you as quirky, odd and unique. You are most likely busy getting on with the job of living your own life in your own way. You like to be free to express your individuality, and may rebel if anyone attempts to stifle your independence. For you this is normal. You like to meet life in your own unique manner, and have plenty of original and exciting ideas to share with humanity. If you stop and take a moment to see the world from other people's eyes you may be surprised, even a little dismayed, to see how much others conform to societal expectations. It is natural for you to seek freedom, independence and new adventures. However, you also have some difficulty settling on one direction, unless it is a cause close to your heart.

*Uranus Conjunction Midheaven
Freedom is tantamount in your life. This is because you feel that you have something unique to contribute to society either through your work, or through your role as a parent.

If you clash with your mother, or your mother's family, then you are likely to go through a rebellious stage, perhaps even becoming a little lost on your life's journey. Nevertheless the lessons learned are invaluable and are likely to be utilised in your profession. As you mature, you are certain that you want the freedom to express your own unique ideas in your public life, as you want to make a contribution to society. You enjoy change and variety, and may make sudden career changes. Science, innovation and technology may feature in your career.

You are a person who easily accepts others. You are not judgmental, except of those who stand in judgment. You believe that all humans, and other creative forces of nature, have a right to live in harmony. However, you do not respond readily to those who enforce their will on others. For this reason you may stand out from the crowd. Others may rely on you to speak up on their behalf. You are a leader rather than a follower.

Conflict arises in your life because you believe your emotions are crazy.

*Uranus Opposition Sun
Your impulsive and unpredictable nature is a source of conflict. You feel that others want to squash your individuality and you rebel. However, your wilful nature is preventing you from achieving your goals in life. You need to find a balance between your own original identity and the needs of other people.

Your generation wants to change society but alternates between rebellion and feeling lost for an alternative. You may revert to opting out of the system. If you can learn to bring substance to your idealism you can create a brave new world.

*Uranus Opposition Chiron

On a personal level: You have a wilful desire for freedom, and are likely to cut ties and to make sudden changes if circumstances or people stand in your way. Your strong desire to express your freedom may be as a result of your inability to face deep emotional wounds. Your task is to honor your intuition and foresight and find a creative outlet for your unique talents. This combination also gives you a sensitivity to esoteric matters. As such you may be drawn to metaphysical matters, cutting-edge ideas and supporting fringe dwellers in society.

*Uranus Opposition NorthNode

You need a marriage that gives you just the right amount of freedom to pursue your independent activities. You also benefit from lively and unusual business partnerships, or a business partnership in an unusual project. If you commit to a partner who does not respect your need for freedom then you are likely to experience conflict, misunderstandings and a mismatch of needs.

*Neptune Conjunction Midheaven
Have you sometimes dreamed of a life riding the ocean waves, working somewhere remote as a lighthouse keeper or spending all day composing sonatas? This is because you yearn to commune with your soul through your profession. Imagination is paramount. You seek a vocation, not just a means to earn money. You don't want to simply pay the bills; you want to pursue your passion. If the fates are smiling on you then you may discover your passion early in life and be provided with options to explore the realms of your creativity and imagination. A life on the ocean waves may be your destiny. The problem is that you are not very practical and it is also likely that other aspects of your life demand that you earn an income through more mundane work. You may have to sacrifice personal ambitions in order to provide a living for yourself and your family. Either way you need to focus on how best you can be of service to those in your care, and to the wider community. If you have a sense of purpose then you are able to enjoy your work, and the ability to be both creative and inspirational in your career. As the Zen proverb states: "Before enlightenment; chop wood, carry water. After enlightenment; chop wood, carry water."

*Neptune Conjunction Imum Coeli
You are a born dreamer. Whether or not your dreams reach fruition depends on other aspects of your birth chart.

However, you may have to face a few skeletons in the family closet before reaching this ideal scenario. Whether or not family members are aware of the skeletons, it's you who needs to face the reality, rather than build a fantasy picture of your childhood home and family. Your home life is likely to have been influenced by your father, in some cases his absence due to work or illness. It's also possible that a grandmother had an important influence on your early childhood and family life. As an adult you may repeatedly attempt to recreate a home that will reflect the ideal held in your mind, or go in search of the security, which was absent as a child. On the other hand you may be well aware of the peculiarities of your childhood home or family, recalling a sense of loss or disillusion. As the memories fade you are able to find a sense of belonging within yourself, and then in your home and an adult family. You're likely to benefit from the healing effects of living near water, or in wide-open spaces. You may also enjoy living in a large apartment block, reveling in the anonymity. It is possible that your spiritual, creative or artistic journey is reflected in your career choice.

*Vesta Conjunction Mars
When you have this combination you need to ensure that you discover what lights your fire and never let the passion fade. Sexuality may be a matter of sacred communication as far as you are concerned. In fact this combination can indicate celibacy, because you are focused on other matters. You may suppress your sexual urges, happy with your own company and with concentrating your energy on inspirational projects. You are destined to direct your energies into something sacred, an activity, project or profession that inspires others. A woman, or group of women, may provide you with the encouragement that you need, but you also need to fan the flames.

*Vesta Conjunction Saturn
This astrological combination can indicate a leader, someone who can build a team of workers or a strong family unit. If you believe in something then you can move mountains.

You may have strong spiritual convictions. These are unlikely to be conventional. Other people may consult you for guidance.

This combination of the fiery planet Mars and the sacred Goddess Vesta indicates that you need to respect your own health and wellbeing and other people's, in particular women. You also need to ensure that you discover what lights your fire and never let the passion fade. Sexuality may be another challenge in your life. You need to develop a reverence for sexual communications. If sex is too hot to handle then you may need to retreat for periods of time, to gather your own creative fires and boundaries.  You are destined to direct your energies into something sacred, an activity, project or profession that inspires others. A woman, or group of women, may provide you with the encouragement that you need, but you also need to fan the flames yourself without resorting to aggression.

*Pallas Conjunction Moon
The Olympian goddess Pallas Athena was a daughter of Zeus, born from her father's head after he had swallowed Metis. The Romans referred to her as Minerva. She is revered as representing the wisdom of reflection and strategy. When combined with the Moon in your chart she emphasises your instinctive need to retreat and formulate a plan before making any emotional leaps of faith. You are a born strategist. 

*Pallas Conjunction Mars
Adventure is likely to have an influence on your relationships. This can mean that you are an independent person who needs an equally independent partner or that you need plenty of freedom to assert yourself in partnerships. You are likely to be assertive in your partnerships, unafraid of confrontation. You may venture into relationships that are not conducive to your own wellbeing and safety. Therefore you need to carefully vet any potentional partner. Also even though you do not fear conflict, you would be well advised to avoid it where possible. Issues of equality, fidelity and traditional roles within relationships are important to you.

*Pallas Conjunction Pluto
You have the ability to be both practical and creative. If you have musical or artistic talent you can give it form and make something long lasting. You are prepared to put in the practice needed to perfect your creative talents. You may be a performer.

*Pallas Square Pluto
You lack confidence in your artistic ability or in your relationships. Learn to believe in yourself and avoid being drawn into the psychic realms as you still have to learn how to deal with the practical side of life.

*Pallas Opposition Mars
The planet Mars can indicate a feisty and independent nature. When combined with the domestic and relationship-oriented Juno it can also indicate conflict in personal relationships. Your own personal needs for independence conflict at times with the needs of your loved ones. It is up to you to try to balance these two opposing forces if you want to enter into an intimate union. Of course you may choose your own independent path, rather than a domestic shared arrangement.

*Pallas Opposition Pluto
You have difficulty giving form to your creative side. Your artistic nature may lack discipline or you may downplay your creative side as you lack confidence in your abilities. Learn to respect both the artistic and the rational side of yourself and finish a creative project. This will feed your self confidence.

*Juno Conjunction Moon
Juno is the domestic Goddess of the Zodiac. When combining with your Moon she highlights your need for domestic warmth, harmony and nurturing. You are likely to nurture your loved ones through food, get-togethers and general conviviality. As one astrologer once said, "Juno is the Nigella Lawson of the Zodiac".  This placement of the Goddess Juno also suggests that emotional bonds with others are important to you. Equality is an attribute about which you feel strongly. This is true for your personal union, and also for humanity. Generally speaking this combination is a blessing enabling you to meet your emotional needs through your connections with others. Others relate to your empathetic nature.

*Juno Conjunction Sun
From a young age you have a certain "presence". As you mature you are likely to become the matriarch or patriarch in your circle of friends, or family. This is because the Goddess Juno is closely associated with your Sun Sign, emphasising any natural abilities that you have to relate to others. You are likely to express yourself best when in relationship with other people. Diplomacy and fairness are likely to be traits that you value. You are fair-minded, adept at putting others at their ease but certainly no push-over. You are likely to have a strong nurturing side to your nature and keen understanding of human nature. You deal equally well with men and women.

*Juno Conjunction Mercury
The manner in which you communicate with other people is likely to have a stronger than usual influence on your major relationships. While others may say what they think without necessarily impacting their loved ones, the words that come from your mouth have a profound effect on your nearest and dearest. This can be a positive trait if you are sensitive and loving in your communications. However, any harsh words are likely to be amplified. You must be just, calm and caring when communicating with others. This can indicate a talent for hospitality, advocacy, counselling, diplomatic postings, writing cook books or other communications that are connected with nurturing people. 

*Juno Conjunction Venus
This is a powerfully feminine combination. Whether in a man or woman's Birth Chart this combination of two potent Goddesses indicates a love of women. Actress Mae West has this connection in her Birth Chart. She epitomises a woman who is voluptuous, feminine and feisty. Mae West is also no shrinking violet. This combination means that you are likely to love passionately and earnestly.  As Mae herself said: "A woman in love can't be reasonable - or she probably wouldn't be in love." This is true for both men and women. You nurture your relationships with people, and possibly also with money. Those around you know that you have an impact wherever you go. Relationships are likely to be a priority in your life.

*Juno Conjunction Saturn
This is a strong indication for marriage, as it is outlines your urge to form a close bond with a loving partner. You may marry someone who is older or in a position of established authority. Social standing is also likely to be a strong factor in your choice of a life partner. You are concerned with stability and longevity, and aim to find a partner who will work with you to establish a respectful place in society. This is not necessarily a romantic union (depending on other factors in your Horoscope), but it is a strong bond based on domestic harmony and shared values.

*Juno Conjunction Uranus
You are a unique individual but the domestic Goddess is unlikely to be a strong part of your daily life. In other words you are more of a free spirit than a homemaker.This combination can indicate that your spirit of independence is at odds with your domestic life. However, if you are aware of the independent side of your nature then you can reach a goodly compromise with anyone who is in your personal life. You are unlikely to possess a strong nurturing side of your personality, but once you are aware of this then you possess the ability to negotiate a domestic arrangement that is of mutual satisfaction. Perhaps you attract someone who appreciates your unique personality and is happy to fulfil the domestic side of your life?

*Juno Conjunction Pluto
You are an ambitious and powerful person. You are a powerful leader and must learn to use your unique insights for positive purposes.

*Juno Square Moon
Relationships with loved ones provide you with emotional sustenance. Therefore you are likely to be nurtured, and to nurture your loved ones through food, get-togethers and general conviviality. However, you need to ensure that your loved ones are on the same wave length. For instance do your loved ones know of your need for nurturing through shared sustenance? Are you giving more than you receive? As one astrologer once said, "Juno is the Nigella Lawson of the Zodiac".  This is because Juno is the domestic Goddess of the Zodiac. When combining with your Moon she highlights your need for domestic warmth, harmony and nurturing. You simply need to ensure that you are nurturing yourself as much as you are looking after others. 

*Juno Square Sun
As a youngster both your mother and father were likely to have influenced the manner in which you relate to other people. Whether this manner is positive or negative depends on other aspects of your Birth Chart. However, it is likely that your mother and father have very different natures. One of your life lessons is to learn to find the balance.

*Juno Square Mercury
The spoken word has a potent effect on your loved ones. When you talk, write, sing or communicate in any manner then you are able to attract a warm and loving audience. However, this is only true if you are speaking kind and loving truth. If you speak harsh words then you may find that you alienate others. Your journey in life is truly blessed with glad tidings when you communicate with love and compassion touching others with your warm and nurturing connections.

*Juno Square Venus
This combination means that you are likely to love passionately and earnestly.  As American actress Mae West once said: "A woman in love can't be reasonable - or she probably wouldn't be in love." This is true for both men and women. Your ardour is strong once aroused. Even when you are not in love with one person, you nurture your relationships with loved ones, and possibly also with money. Those around you know that you have an impact wherever you go. You need to ensure that you show some restraint when it comes to your own passions.

*Juno Square Pluto
You have difficulty accepting your faults, which you see as weaknesses. This is because you are spurred to ambition by your need for security. Once you learn to accept your own and other people's limitations you will wield much personal power.

*Juno Opposition Moon
Relationships with loved ones provide you with emotional sustenance. Therefore you are likely to be nurtured, and to nurture your loved ones through food, get-togethers and general conviviality.

When combining with your Moon she highlights your need for domestic warmth, harmony and nurturing. You simply need to ensure that you are nurturing yourself as much as you are looking after others.

*Juno Opposition Sun
As a youngster both your mother and father were likely to have influenced the manner in which you relate to other people. Whether this manner is positive or negative depends on other aspects of your Birth Chart. However, it is likely that your mother and father have very different natures. One of your life lessons is to learn to find the balance between these two opposing forces. On the one hand you have a strong need to express your own personality. On the other hand you are keen to look after other people. You need to learn to balance both.

*Juno Opposition Mercury
The spoken word has a potent effect on your loved ones. When you talk, write, sing or communicate in any manner then you are able to attract a warm and loving audience.

You have great potential for power but may lack emotional security. This can make you appear dictatorial. You are torn between your need for security and the power you are able to wield, which involves taking risks.

*Juno Trine Moon
Relationships with loved ones provide you with emotional sustenance. Therefore you are likely to be nurtured, and to nurture your loved ones through food, get-togethers and general conviviality. As one astrologer once said, "Juno is the Nigella Lawson of the Zodiac".  This is because Juno is the domestic Goddess of the Zodiac. When combining with your Moon she highlights your need for domestic warmth, harmony and nurturing.

*Juno Trine Sun
Juno is a potent Goddess with a variety of roles and functions. She is protector of women and children, adviser to the people, and in a way marriage counsellor. She was also known as Juno Moneta and the first Roman coins had her image on the face, and were naturally called "moneta", from which the term "money" is derived. Therefore all of these themes may feature in your life. You are likely to be attracted to these roles - protector, adviser, money manager. They are part of your innate talents.

*Juno Trine Mercury
You have a gift for listening to other people's stories and empathising. This is a rare thing. Your advice is usually sage, and your opinions insightful.

Nevertheless it is a strong indicator of a compassionate and just nature.

You like to meet life in your own unique manner, and have plenty of original and exciting ideas to share with humanity. If you stop and take a moment to see the world from other people's eyes you may be surprised, even a little dismayed, to see how much others conform to societal expectations.

You are a person who easily accepts others. You are not judgmental, except of those who stand in judgment. You believe that all humans, and other creative forces of nature, have a right to live in harmony. However, you do not respond readily to those who enforce their will on others. For this reason you may stand out from the crowd. Others may rely on you to speak up on their behalf. You are a leader rather than a follower.

*Ascendant Opposition Moon
You need to be needed by your loved ones. You seek close emotional bonds with those nearest and dearest and find it difficult to spend time on your own.

*Ascendant Opposition Uranus
The planet Uranus is in the 7th House of your Birth Chart suggesting that you've a need for an unconventional relationship, if indeed you see any need for one partner at all.

You need a marriage that gives you just the right amount of freedom to pursue your independent activities. You also benefit from lively and unusual business partnerships, or a business partnership in an unusual project. If you commit to a partner who does not respect your need for freedom then you are likely to experience conflict, misunderstandings and a mismatch of needs.

Then you can create a unique union which is lively, interactive and certainly never boring.

This is a prominent placement of the Sun indicating that you are keen to make your mark on the world. You want to leave a legacy whether through your chosen profession, an official position in a group or club, or your children. You like to shine in the public eye.

Therefore you are likely to receive support enabling you to achieve your life ambitions. Others are happy to see you have your moment, or moments, in the sun. You need only set your goals, pace yourself and shine. As US General S Patton once said: "I do not fear failure. I only fear the 'slowing up' of the engine inside of me which is pounding, saying, 'Keep going, someone must be on top, why not you?'"

*Midheaven Conjunction Mercury
You are happiest when you are learning new skills, which you can use in to get ahead in life. In other words you don't like to be bored when it comes to your main occupation. If you are bored then you are likely to want to change your job, escape on a trip, or perhaps distract yourself with spending money or a dalliance at work. You need to be stimulated. You may well be an intellect, maneuvering your path through the school system, into post-graduate studies and then into a career that makes full use of your mind. Writing, teaching, lecturing, research and politics are just a few that come to mind. On the other hand you may be a practical person who likes to use your hands, learning new skills as a tradesman. Another possibility is that you like to be on the move working as a taxi or truck driver, a courier or operating some sort of machinery. You may excel in sales and marketing where you can fully utilize your gift for chatting with customers and colleagues. Whatever your chosen career the key element is that it keeps you interested. As a child, and as an adult, you are likely to get into mischief if your main occupation is boring.  You need to live by your wits, maintain your interest in your work but you also need to learn a little self-discipline. You do well to remember the long-term benefits that sometimes accompany short-term discomfort. Then you are likely to excel in any chosen profession.

*Midheaven Conjunction Venus
You are a charming and soothing person, able to use your charm to help both yourself and other people on life's journey. You believe in co-operation, not competition, and therefore you are an asset in any profession that requires teamwork, personnel skills and diplomacy.

While generally you land on your feet when it comes to seeking new jobs, you may also benefit from learning some self-soothing techniques, or indulging in an enjoyable pastime that helps alleviate any temporary work stress. While you can excel at any chosen profession you may be attracted to the arts, beauty, fashion, graphic design, leisure, hospitality, or public relations, to name a few.

*Midheaven Conjunction Mars
Self-confidence plays a vital role in how you handle your professional life. If you had a stable and loving home life, as depicted in other aspects of your birth chart, then you are likely to stride forth into the world with confidence. You set your goals, work steadily towards achieving them and then enjoy your success in any chosen profession. Of course sports, politics, and law may feature. On the other hand if you lack self-confidence then you may falter in your chosen career. You may start with the very best of intentions, setting your goals and moving forward. However, any obstacles or conflict may upset your course. As a result you could suffer from stress-related illnesses at the sign of any professional setback.  You may also make rash decisions which adversely affect your advancement in life. If this is the case then you need to seek professional advice either through personal counseling, vocational guidance or some other such course of action that helps you build your esteem, make wise choices and achieve the success that you so desire. The prominent placement of the planet Mars does indicate that success is within your reach if you can learn how to grasp and enjoy.

*Midheaven Conjunction Jupiter
The Gods are smiling on you in this lifetime. You have the planet of Kings placed prominently in your chart. This means that life is likely to be good unless other aspects of your birth chart are contradictory. As a child you enjoy positive attention and benefits from your parents. One or both of your parents are considered to be of high character and may hold a prominent position in society. Your talents are encouraged and you are urged to explore many options in life. As you mature you are eager to explore the world, and may travel, study or do an apprenticeship that leads you into a rewarding profession. You are likely to receive many blessings from benefactors, as well as recognition for your talents. If you prefer to become a parent early in life then you are likely to meet a suitable marriage partner, someone who supports and enhances your life, enabling you to pursue your goals. Your life is blessed. When one door closes, another one opens with ease. You may need to temper some of your good luck with a modicum of restraint, learning when to hold back and when to move forward. Otherwise you need only contemplate where you want to spread your good fortune for the benefit of yourself and other people.

*Midheaven Conjunction Saturn
Slow and steady wins the race. Yes, you do want to win. You are ambitious, even from a young age. You don't always win the popularity contest but you don't really care. You learn, from a young age, that popularity is not high on your list of ambitions. Respect is. You would like to achieve something of substance in your chosen field. You want expertise. Your profession is likely to be practical, something concrete which produces results either for you or for other people. Building, engineering, accounting, computing and other such development tools are just a few options. No matter what you choose, you are hardworking and responsible in your application.  It is possible that you suffer some frustrations and setbacks early in life as you undergo your apprenticeship, however; once on the right path, you will advance and gain the respect of others. As you advance you may also train others in your area of expertise.

*Midheaven Conjunction Uranus
Freedom is tantamount in your life. This is because you feel that you have something unique to contribute to society either through your work, or through your role as a parent. It is likely that your mother is a significant influence in your life, hopefully encouraging you to be independent and strong-minded in the best sense of the word. If you clash with your mother, or your mother's family, then you are likely to go through a rebellious stage, perhaps even becoming a little lost on your life's journey. Nevertheless the lessons learned are invaluable and are likely to be utilised in your profession. As you mature, you are certain that you want the freedom to express your own unique ideas in your public life, as you want to make a contribution to society. You enjoy change and variety, and may make sudden career changes. Science, innovation and technology may feature in your career. You continue to be likely to rebel against anyone who tried to assert their authority. You want to be master or mistress of your own destiny, and will strike out on your own rather than conform to someone else's assertions.

*Midheaven Conjunction Neptune
Have you sometimes dreamed of a life riding the ocean waves, working somewhere remote as a lighthouse keeper or spending all day composing sonatas? This is because you yearn to commune with your soul through your profession. Imagination is paramount. You seek a vocation, not just a means to earn money. You don't want to simply pay the bills; you want to pursue your passion. If the fates are smiling on you then you may discover your passion early in life and be provided with options to explore the realms of your creativity and imagination. A life on the ocean waves may be your destiny. The problem is that you are not very practical and it is also likely that other aspects of your life demand that you earn an income through more mundane work. You may have to sacrifice personal ambitions in order to provide a living for yourself and your family. Either way you need to focus on how best you can be of service to those in your care, and to the wider community. If you have a sense of purpose then you are able to enjoy your work, and the ability to be both creative and inspirational in your career. As the Zen proverb states: "Before enlightenment; chop wood, carry water. After enlightenment; chop wood, carry water."

*Midheaven Conjunction Pluto
You will be powerful and resourceful in your chosen career, and may have a transformative effect on those around you. For this reason, you make a better leader than a follower. You may find that you choose a career that enables to you delve to the bottom of things. This can be literally plumbing or mining, or delving into the human psyche in career paths such as psychology.

*Midheaven Conjunction Chiron
Do you ever feel like the odd one out in your chosen profession? You are talking but no one else listens? Perhaps you wonder why you are the one who is always overlooked for a promotion? This is because you are different - in a good way. You are a prophet in your own profession, but your skills are not necessarily of an imminently practical nature. Therefore other people don't immediately see the measure of your worth. This can be painful, particularly if events or people trigger subconscious recollections of rejection by your parents. It is possible that your mother, or both parents, did not listen to you or encourage your choices. At school you may have been encourage to study subjects that were not suited to your talents. As a result you felt lost, unable to achieve, when really all you needed was to take a different path. Your initial career choice may not reflect your true purpose. Hence you still feel like a fish out of water. Eventually a light switches on and one of two things can happen. You begin to value your own worth within your current occupation, or you change career paths. Healing, spirituality, and any of the feminine arts may suit you professionally. No matter what your career, you bring much wisdom to your chosen profession. Once you accept an alternative career, or a different attitude then doors open and you receive the recognition that you truly need. Ironically this recognition may not come from other people but from a deep sense of satisfaction that you are on the right path.

*Midheaven Conjunction Eris
The placement of the troublesome Eris in the career sector of your birth chart indicates that you are likely to experience conflict in your chosen profession. This could be conflict with people in authority, or as a result of difficult co-workers. Early in your career this is likely to disturb you. However, gradually you learn to handle opposing parties, knowing when to step away and how to protect yourself from other people's problems. Eventually you may opt for a different career, choosing to work in an arena that deals directly with troubled sections of the community such as in social work, the police, the armed forces or environmental law to name a few. 

*Midheaven Square Moon
Your emotions are likely to affect your choice of career. Therefore you need to make sure that you strike out on your own journey rather than trying to please one or both of your parents.

*Midheaven Opposition Moon
Most people are influenced by their home and family. However, you are particularly sensitive to the ebb and flow of family life. As a young child you enjoy spending time in your home, relating to those who share your household as well as extended family members. If you grow up in a warm and supportive family environment then you are likely to enjoy an equally happy household as an adult. If you suffer at the hands of your family then your journey may be rockier. At some stage you are likely to break away, determined to create a sense of security in your own home. You may start a family of your own with the view of developing a warm and safe household. Safety and security at home are vital factors for your health and happiness. You need a safe haven. Your home does not necessarily need to be a large mansion, but you do need to feel comfortable. You are likely to be a force to be reckoned with in your family life. Other family members may come and go, but you are the one likely to be a guiding hand and a comfort for family members. You may be the keeper of family memories with photographic displays, books, and stories to tell. The family history fascinates you, perhaps even compelling you to research and record facts and stories.

*Midheaven Opposition Sun
Your identity is intricately linked with your family. As a young child your family, in particular your father, played a prominent role in influencing your personality, decisions, values and all facets of your life. Depending on other aspects of your birth chart this could have been a positive or negative experience. Either way you see yourself as part of a family system. Whereas friends and colleagues may have struck out on their own path early in life, you are more likely to have stayed close to home and hearth. Even if you moved out of the family home, it is likely that you stayed in the neighbourhood or in close touch with family members. Quite simply family is of utmost importance in your life. All that you achieve is likely to be as a direct result of the positive, and perhaps negative, influences of your experiences growing up in the family home. As an adult you are likely to find a home and start a family of your own, as this is more important to you than establishing a career, travelling, or other such public adventures. You may be a private person, preferring to gather a few close friends or family members in your own home. Even if you enjoy social and professional forays you are still likely to require a safe haven - your home. You are likely to shine at any family occasion, and may prefer to work from home or be the household manager. 

*Midheaven Opposition Mercury
Ancient astrologers considered this placement to be a prominent one indicating that the planet Mercury, and all things related, are likely to be a strong influence in your life. Starting with your early childhood you are likely to be curious. If a naturally outgoing child then you are likely to approach adults in your home, family and vicinity with a multitude of questions. If more introverted then you are likely to read books, watch television and explore the world wide web. You learn much from your early home life, preferring the stimulation of an active family. Activity feeds your curious mind. Later in life you replicate this scenario in your own home. You are likely to establish many pastimes within your home, and may even work from home. Whether or not you live on your own, or have a large family, you enjoy a busy household. In some cases this could spill into your career choice. You may choose a profession as a merchant, teacher, writer, researcher, tradesperson, courier or any such job that stimulates your need to make new discoveries inside or outside your own household.

*Midheaven Opposition Venus
No matter what else is happening in your life you like to be able to come home to beautiful, peaceful surroundings. If you live alone then you are likely to find a house that reflects your need for tranquility and creativity. If you share your home with other family members, then you like to ensure that everyone is having a good time. You are the peacemaker, the diplomat and a loving member of any household. You enjoy relating to your family and friends, and making sure that they are at peace with themselves. Any conflict is likely to be upsetting. Sometimes you can sit on the fence when it comes to family politics, but you prefer this to becoming embroiled in other people's problems. You want fun, creativity and harmony. Your personal interests may reflect these qualities. You may possess beautiful artifacts, and artistic talents to complement your charming disposition. These are potent qualities. Your main profession does not necessarily reflect your artistic or personal gifts, however; you are likely to express them in some public arena. For instance your day job may be a practical one that earns you good money, however; at night you revel in amateur arts organisations. Your main job may be as a homemaker but you enjoy demonstrating at cosmetic or fashion parties and earning extra money at night. The most important thing for you is having a sense of peace in your private life.

*Midheaven Opposition Mars
The placement of the energetic planet Mars in the home and family section of your birth chart indicates that you had a lively upbringing. This could have been a stimulating and enjoyable experience, or you could have suffered as a result of strife and trouble. Perhaps it was a little of both. As a result of your childhood experiences you are likely to find it a little difficult to settle in one place in early adulthood. Positively speaking this could lead to some real adventures as you travel far afield seeking new experiences. You learn from your experiences. Once you have chosen one place in which to nest, then you need plenty of activity within your house. You may share with many people, or perhaps you could develop some robust home activities such as renovation projects or a home gym. You need an outlet for your boundless energy, as well as a respect for the fact that other household members may require a quieter existence. If you are bored you can be quite the agitator, annoying those around you. Therefore some home activities that demand your energy can be therapeutic for everyone.

*Midheaven Opposition Jupiter
The planet of Kings is in a significant position in your birth chart, suggesting that the Gods are smiling on your home and family. These are two areas of your life that provide much satisfaction and pleasure. You put a lot of time and effort into your home, making sure that everything runs smoothly and that all is comfortable and attractive. Home decoration may be something for which you've a special talent. You may express this in your private life by decorating your own home, or perhaps choose a profession that helps you express this talent. It's likely that your home or property is large and expansive, providing you with a sense of well being. If not then perhaps you live in a wide-open space or near the ocean. You like to be able to escape the petty details of daily life by relaxing in or around your home. Whether your home is large or not, there's a sense of expansiveness which can be enjoyed by all. It's not only the building, which is important, but also your loved ones. You like to know that they are comfortable and well cared for. Your immediate family may be quite large, or perhaps you have a large extended family.  Depending on other aspects of your birth chart, you're likely to gain property through investment or inheritances. Ancient astrologers believe that the planet Jupiter has a beneficial effect in a person's birth chart. They also believe that it's in a favourable position in the angular fourth house. This means that you're likely to be successful in achieving your goals and live to a comfortable old age.

*Midheaven Opposition Saturn
The serious planet Saturn is in a significant position in your birth chart suggesting that family responsibilities need to be attended to before you can succeed in the public world. This can mean that some serious childhood matters need to be faced and dealt with before you can move forward on your own life's journey. Perhaps these matters are connected to your father, or your father's family. Your early family life may not have been as supportive as you would have liked, resulting in you feeling a lack of a firm footing.  In some cases it could be that your family life was generally secure but that your parents moved house, forcing you to begin again in a new environment and creating a sense of insecurity. While some children adapt well to new homes and neighbourhoods, you had difficulty coping with the changes. As you grow and mature you find that you've to come to terms with these early difficulties. Gradually you learn how to build up a solid foundation that suits you and your home life becomes a solid base for you and you are ready to branch out and secure a future through your profession, or through marriage and a family of your own. The ancient prophets believed that this was a highly significant placement for the planet Saturn and therefore you are likely to have learnt some valuable lessons. Perhaps you realise that there is no point in holding on to the past but rather to focus on the foundations of the present moment.

*Midheaven Opposition Uranus
There is nothing conventional about your household, which is just the way you like it. You enjoy having the freedom to express your individual nature in your home, whether that means decorating your home in just the way that you like, or neglecting the household completely in favour of other stimulating pursuits.

*Midheaven Opposition Neptune
You are a born dreamer. Whether or not your dreams reach fruition depends on other aspects of your birth chart. Ideally you seek a place of refuge that enables you to withdraw from society, contemplate nature and beauty and indulge in imaginative pastimes at home. However, you may have to face a few skeletons in the family closet before reaching this ideal scenario. Whether or not family members are aware of the skeletons, it's you who needs to face the reality, rather than build a fantasy picture of your childhood home and family. Your home life is likely to have been influenced by your father, in some cases his absence due to work or illness. It's also possible that a grandmother had an important influence on your early childhood and family life. As an adult you may repeatedly attempt to recreate a home that will reflect the ideal held in your mind, or go in search of the security, which was absent as a child. On the other hand you may be well aware of the peculiarities of your childhood home or family, recalling a sense of loss or disillusion. As the memories fade you are able to find a sense of belonging within yourself, and then in your home and an adult family. You're likely to benefit from the healing effects of living near water, or in wide-open spaces. You may also enjoy living in a large apartment block, reveling in the anonymity. It is possible that your spiritual, creative or artistic journey is reflected in your career choice.

*Midheaven Opposition Pluto
The planet Pluto here indicates that your home environment may be a challenge. It's possible that you've been affected by early childhood traumas, either by one particularly disturbing event in your family life, or by a series of upheavals. Perhaps one of your parents was an overwhelming, powerful figure in your life or had a powerful affect on your life for other reasons. This is likely to be your father, or a member of your father's family. As a result your adult home life is likely to reflect your childhood problems. Perhaps you're constantly changing homes, or perhaps you simply struggle to feel at peace in your home. You need to be careful that you don't recreate your childhood traumas in your home environment by living with someone who is abusive. Your challenge is to assert your own rights within your family without resorting to aggression, or without becoming the victim of someone else's aggressive behaviour or perpetuating any trauma. Your childhood experiences can be a source of wisdom as you mature, enabling you to form a strong foundation in your own life, and for family members. This placement can also influence your choice of career. For this reason you may work in a field such as psychology, aged care, real estate, or politics.

*Midheaven Opposition Chiron
Early childhood is not always easy with this placement of Chiron. Your family life does not support your true self. This may be linked to your relationship with your father, rather than your mother. Perhaps you feel rejected, or neglected, by your father? You are likely to repeat this pattern until you can find a place in which you truly belong, somewhere deep inside yourself that feels safe. Once this occurs then you can form a home, and family environment, that is secure and loving. You are likely to then be a loving and healing presence in your family.

*Midheaven Trine Chiron
 Healing, spirituality, and any of the feminine arts may suit you professionally. No matter what your career, you bring much wisdom to your chosen profession. You may not follow a traditional path, or you may have an alternative approach to a conventional profession. You need to accept that you are different. Once you accept an alternative career, or a different attitude then doors open and you receive the recognition that you truly need. This recognition may or may not come from other people but it will come from a deep sense of satisfaction that you are on the right path.

You are likely to crave recognition for your achievements. This may come in the form of praise from your colleagues or bosses, or if you receive awards in your industry.

You are serious about your relationships, preferring to bide your time until a serious and committed relationship comes along, rather than experiencing many different relationships.

*Imum Coeli Conjunction Moon
Most people are influenced by their home and family. However, you are particularly sensitive to the ebb and flow of family life. As a young child you enjoy spending time in your home, relating to those who share your household as well as extended family members. If you grow up in a warm and supportive family environment then you are likely to enjoy an equally happy household as an adult. If you suffer at the hands of your family then your journey may be rockier. At some stage you are likely to break away, determined to create a sense of security in your own home. You may start a family of your own with the view of developing a warm and safe household. Safety and security at home are vital factors for your health and happiness. You need a safe haven. Your home does not necessarily need to be a large mansion, but you do need to feel comfortable. You are likely to be a force to be reckoned with in your family life. Other family members may come and go, but you are the one likely to be a guiding hand and a comfort for family members. You may be the keeper of family memories with photographic displays, books, and stories to tell. The family history fascinates you, perhaps even compelling you to research and record facts and stories.

*Imum Coeli Conjunction Sun
Your identity is intricately linked with your family. As a young child your family, in particular your father, played a prominent role in influencing your personality, decisions, values and all facets of your life. Depending on other aspects of your birth chart this could have been a positive or negative experience. Either way you see yourself as part of a family system. Whereas friends and colleagues may have struck out on their own path early in life, you are more likely to have stayed close to home and hearth. Even if you moved out of the family home, it is likely that you stayed in the neighbourhood or in close touch with family members. Quite simply family is of utmost importance in your life. All that you achieve is likely to be as a direct result of the positive, and perhaps negative, influences of your experiences growing up in the family home. As an adult you are likely to find a home and start a family of your own, as this is more important to you than establishing a career, travelling, or other such public adventures. You may be a private person, preferring to gather a few close friends or family members in your own home. Even if you enjoy social and professional forays you are still likely to require a safe haven - your home. You are likely to shine at any family occasion, and may prefer to work from home or be the household manager. 

*Imum Coeli Conjunction Mercury
Ancient astrologers considered this placement to be a prominent one indicating that the planet Mercury, and all things related, are likely to be a strong influence in your life. Starting with your early childhood you are likely to be curious. If a naturally outgoing child then you are likely to approach adults in your home, family and vicinity with a multitude of questions. If more introverted then you are likely to read books, watch television and explore the world wide web. You learn much from your early home life, preferring the stimulation of an active family. Activity feeds your curious mind. Later in life you replicate this scenario in your own home. You are likely to establish many pastimes within your home, and may even work from home. Whether or not you live on your own, or have a large family, you enjoy a busy household. In some cases this could spill into your career choice. You may choose a profession as a merchant, teacher, writer, researcher, tradesperson, courier or any such job that stimulates your need to make new discoveries inside or outside your own household.

*Imum Coeli Conjunction Venus
No matter what else is happening in your life you like to be able to come home to beautiful, peaceful surroundings. If you live alone then you are likely to find a house that reflects your need for tranquility and creativity. If you share your home with other family members, then you like to ensure that everyone is having a good time. You are the peacemaker, the diplomat and a loving member of any household. You enjoy relating to your family and friends, and making sure that they are at peace with themselves. Any conflict is likely to be upsetting. Sometimes you can sit on the fence when it comes to family politics, but you prefer this to becoming embroiled in other people's problems. You want fun, creativity and harmony. Your personal interests may reflect these qualities. You may possess beautiful artifacts, and artistic talents to complement your charming disposition. These are potent qualities. Your main profession does not necessarily reflect your artistic or personal gifts, however; you are likely to express them in some public arena. For instance your day job may be a practical one that earns you good money, however; at night you revel in amateur arts organisations. Your main job may be as a homemaker but you enjoy demonstrating at cosmetic or fashion parties and earning extra money at night. The most important thing for you is having a sense of peace in your private life.

*Imum Coeli Conjunction Mars
The placement of the energetic planet Mars in the home and family section of your birth chart indicates that you had a lively upbringing. This could have been a stimulating and enjoyable experience, or you could have suffered as a result of strife and trouble. Perhaps it was a little of both. As a result of your childhood experiences you are likely to find it a little difficult to settle in one place in early adulthood. Positively speaking this could lead to some real adventures as you travel far afield seeking new experiences. You learn from your experiences. Once you have chosen one place in which to nest, then you need plenty of activity within your house. You may share with many people, or perhaps you could develop some robust home activities such as renovation projects or a home gym. You need an outlet for your boundless energy, as well as a respect for the fact that other household members may require a quieter existence. If you are bored you can be quite the agitator, annoying those around you. Therefore some home activities that demand your energy can be therapeutic for everyone.

*Imum Coeli Conjunction Jupiter
The planet of Kings is in a significant position in your birth chart, suggesting that the Gods are smiling on your home and family. These are two areas of your life that provide much satisfaction and pleasure. You put a lot of time and effort into your home, making sure that everything runs smoothly and that all is comfortable and attractive. Home decoration may be something for which you've a special talent. You may express this in your private life by decorating your own home, or perhaps choose a profession that helps you express this talent. It's likely that your home or property is large and expansive, providing you with a sense of well being. If not then perhaps you live in a wide-open space or near the ocean. You like to be able to escape the petty details of daily life by relaxing in or around your home. Whether your home is large or not, there's a sense of expansiveness which can be enjoyed by all. It's not only the building, which is important, but also your loved ones. You like to know that they are comfortable and well cared for. Your immediate family may be quite large, or perhaps you have a large extended family.  Depending on other aspects of your birth chart, you're likely to gain property through investment or inheritances.

*Imum Coeli Opposition Moon
This is a prominent placement for the Moon indicating that you have a strong inclination to find your purpose in life and express it through your career or through parenthood. Your emotions are likely to affect your choice of career. Therefore you need to make sure that you strike out on your own journey rather than trying to please one or both of your parents. You also need to ensure that you like and respect anyone who holds authority in your chosen profession. Otherwise you may feel uncomfortable at work. You are likely to crave recognition for your achievements. This may come in the form of praise from your colleagues or bosses, or if you receive awards in your industry. You are sensitive about your role in public, and seek a sense of security from your chosen profession. The more that you feel that you are steering your life in the right direction the more happy you are likely to be in all areas. In the same way that you feel comforted when your career is stable, you may also comfort others through your chosen profession. Perhaps you enjoy looking after your workmates, listening to their troubles and bringing them little treats, or maybe your career is in a helping profession, or the hospitality industry. Your life choices may be strongly influenced from childhood through to adulthood by your mother, or another matriach in your family.

*Imum Coeli Opposition Sun
This is a prominent placement of the Sun indicating that you are keen to make your mark on the world. You want to leave a legacy whether through your chosen profession, an official position in a group or club, or your children. You like to shine in the public eye. This could literally mean that you choose a career that propels you into the limelight such acting, singing, politics or teaching. However, it could simply mean that you are ambitious, keen to make it to the top in any field. Your reputation is important. This is a fortunate position of the Sun. Therefore you are likely to receive support enabling you to achieve your life ambitions. Others are happy to see you have your moment, or moments, in the sun. You need only set your goals, pace yourself and shine. As US General S Patton once said: "I do not fear failure. I only fear the 'slowing up' of the engine inside of me which is pounding, saying, 'Keep going, someone must be on top, why not you?'"

*Imum Coeli Opposition Mercury
You are happiest when you are learning new skills, which you can use in to get ahead in life. In other words you don't like to be bored when it comes to your main occupation. If you are bored then you are likely to want to change your job, escape on a trip, or perhaps distract yourself with spending money or a dalliance at work. You need to be stimulated. You may well be an intellect, maneuvering your path through the school system, into post-graduate studies and then into a career that makes full use of your mind. Writing, teaching, lecturing, research and politics are just a few that come to mind. On the other hand you may be a practical person who likes to use your hands, learning new skills as a tradesman. Another possibility is that you like to be on the move working as a taxi or truck driver, a courier or operating some sort of machinery. You may excel in sales and marketing where you can fully utilize your gift for chatting with customers and colleagues. Whatever your chosen career the key element is that it keeps you interested. As a child, and as an adult, you are likely to get into mischief if your main occupation is boring.  You need to live by your wits, maintain your interest in your work but you also need to learn a little self-discipline.
