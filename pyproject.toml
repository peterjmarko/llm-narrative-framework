# --- Definitive Coverage Workflow ---
# This is the robust, explicit workflow for subprocess testing. It has 5 steps:
# 1. Erase old data.
# 2. Use `coverage run` as the main entry point to start the test session.
# 3. Your test helper also calls `coverage run` for the subprocess.
#    (This creates parallel data files thanks to your .coveragerc)
# 4. `coverage combine` merges all parallel data into one file.
# 5. `coverage report` or `coverage html` shows the final, correct results.

# --- THE DEFINITIVE COVERAGE SCRIPTS ---
# We disable the pytest-cov plugin with `-p no:cov` because we are manually
# invoking 'coverage run' within our test's subprocesses.
# This prevents the plugin from interfering with our manual setup.
