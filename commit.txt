fix(audit): resolve all verification failures for legacy and new data

This commit addresses a series of cascading bugs in the experiment
auditor (`--verify-only` mode) that caused incorrect failure reports.

Key fixes include:
- Corrected the file search logic to use full sub-directory paths,
  resolving `SESSION_QUERIES_MISSING` errors.
- Enforced the use of precise regular expressions for counting trial
  files, preventing `SESSION_QUERIES_TOO_MANY` errors from extra
  non-trial files in the directory.
- Refactored the analysis file validation to use the definitive
  `n_valid_responses` metric from the `replication_report.txt` JSON as
  the ground truth. This ensures the check correctly handles runs with
  fewer than 100% valid responses, which is common in migrated
  legacy experiments.
- Updated CONTRIBUTING.md to clarify the commit and versioning workflow,
  and added `commit.txt` to `.gitignore`.

With these changes, the audit function now correctly validates both new
and migrated experiments, providing a reliable and robust verification
of data integrity.
