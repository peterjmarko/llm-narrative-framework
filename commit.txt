fix(workflow): improve migration progress display and Ctrl-C handling

Adds a progress bar to `rebuild_reports.py` when run in non-verbose mode to provide high-level feedback during the migration workflow.

Implements graceful `KeyboardInterrupt` (Ctrl+C) handling in `experiment_manager.py` and `rebuild_reports.py` to prevent stack traces on user cancellation.

Adjusts the color of header text in `migrate_experiment.ps1` for consistency.
