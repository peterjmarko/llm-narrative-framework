fix(workflow): improve script usability and test reliability

- Adds graceful Ctrl+C handling to `experiment_manager.py` to prevent stack traces on user interruption.
- Implements a progress bar in the migration workflow's report rebuilding step for better user feedback on long-running operations.
- Corrects the mock argument order in `test_rebuild_reports.py` to fix failing tests and ensure test suite stability.
- Updates `CONTRIBUTING.md` to document the more robust, two-step commit and release process.
