fix(migration-and-update): resolve infinite-migration loop and drop STUDY_results.csv

- Eliminate STUDY_results.csv entirely; aggregator now outputs only REPLICATION / EXPERIMENT CSVs  
- Prevent infinite loop in legacy-migration workflow by ensuring state transitions NEW_NEEDED → COMPLETE  
- update_experiment.ps1 enforces step-wise VERIFY → REPAIR/REPROCESS logic, never loops more than once  
- Mermaid diagram and docstrings updated to reflect final artifact list
