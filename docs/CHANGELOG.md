## v2.1.0 (2025-07-16)

### Feat

- **workflow,manager**: enhance update workflow with pre-check audit and robust error handling

## v2.0.6 (2025-07-16)

### Fix

- **audit**: complete audit logic and improve report readability

    This commit finalizes the experiment audit functionality, making it
    fully comprehensive and visually readable.

    Key changes include:
    - Added new checks to verify the presence and completeness of
      experiment-level (`EXPERIMENT_results.csv`) and replication-level
      (`REPLICATION_results.csv`) summary files.
    - Corrected the audit summary to use the definitive `n_valid_responses`
      from replication reports, ensuring an accurate total.
    - Improved the visual layout of the console audit report by truncating
      long directory names for better alignment.

## v2.0.5 (2025-07-16)

### Fix

- **audit**: finalize audit logic for all file types and outputs

    This commit resolves all remaining issues with the experiment audit
    function, making it fully robust for both new and migrated data.

    Key changes include:
    - The `FILE_MANIFEST` was updated with the correct file patterns for
      `mappings.txt` and the trial-level `llm_query_*_manifest.txt` files,
      resolving incorrect failure reports.
    - The audit logic for optional trial manifests is now conditional,
      ensuring legacy runs without these files are correctly validated.
    - The `audit_experiment.ps1` wrapper script has been enhanced to
      simultaneously display colored output in the console while saving a

## v2.0.4 (2025-07-16)

### Fix

- **audit**: resolve all verification failures for legacy and new data

    This commit addresses a series of cascading bugs in the experiment
    auditor (`--verify-only` mode) that caused incorrect failure reports.

    Key fixes include:
    - Corrected the file search logic to use full sub-directory paths,
      resolving `SESSION_QUERIES_MISSING` errors.
    - Enforced the use of precise regular expressions for counting trial
      files, preventing `SESSION_QUERIES_TOO_MANY` errors from extra
      non-trial files in the directory.
    - Refactored the analysis file validation to use the definitive
      `n_valid_responses` metric from the `replication_report.txt` JSON as

## v2.0.3 (2025-07-16)

### Refactor

- **audit**: harden and isolate config validation logic

    This commit refactors the configuration verification logic within the
    experiment_manager.py audit/verify mode.

    The validation logic now uses a self-contained, hardcoded compatibility
    map within the script's FILE_MANIFEST. This intentional design choice
    insulates the audit function from any changes to the live, project-level
    config.ini, ensuring that historical experiments can be reliably and
    reproducibly validated over time without external dependencies.

    This change resolves issues where the audit was failing incorrectly by
    making the verifier a stable, self-contained tool.

## v2.0.2 (2025-07-15)

### Fix

- **migration-and-update**: resolve infinite-migration loop and drop STUDY_results.csv
    - Eliminate STUDY_results.csv entirely; aggregator now outputs only REPLICATION / EXPERIMENT CSVs  
    - Prevent infinite loop in legacy-migration workflow by ensuring state transitions NEW_NEEDED → COMPLETE  
    - update_experiment.ps1 enforces step-wise VERIFY → REPAIR/REPROCESS logic, never loops more than once  
    - Mermaid diagram and docstrings updated to reflect final artifact list

## v2.0.1 (2025-07-15)

### Fix

- **workflow**: improve script usability and test reliability
    - Adds graceful Ctrl+C handling to `experiment_manager.py` to prevent stack traces on user interruption.
    - Implements a progress bar in the migration workflow's report rebuilding step for better user feedback on long-running operations.
    - Corrects the mock argument order in `test_rebuild_reports.py` to fix failing tests and ensure test suite stability.
    - Updates `CONTRIBUTING.md` to document the more robust, two-step commit and release process.

## v2.0.0 (2025-07-14)

### BREAKING CHANGE

    - The `migrate_experiment.ps1` script's signature has changed. It no longer accepts a `-TargetDirectory` for in-place modification. Instead, it requires a `-SourceDirectory` and automatically handles the destination.

### Feat

- **workflow**: implement non-destructive migration and --reprocess flag

    - **build**: Automate documentation and diagram generation
    - Enhance final analysis workflow and reporting
    - Enhance analysis and untrack generated code files
