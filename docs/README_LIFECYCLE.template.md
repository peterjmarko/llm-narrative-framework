# Experiment & Study Lifecycle Guide

This document provides a high-level guide to the framework's core research workflow. Its purpose is to explain how the main user-facing scripts are used together to create, validate, and analyze a study.

## Project Architecture

The experiment and study lifecycle scripts represent the "Core Logic" of the framework. They are executed by user-facing PowerShell scripts and operate on the data generated by the Data Preparation Pipeline.

## Experimental Hierarchy

The framework organizes research into a clear hierarchy. Understanding this structure is key to using the workflow scripts correctly.

```
Study
└── Experiment (Condition A)
    ├── Replication 1
    │   ├── Trial 1
    │   ├── Trial 2
    │   └── ...
    └── Replication 2
        └── ...
└── Experiment (Condition B)
    ├── Replication 1
    │   └── ...
    └── Replication 2
        └── ...
```

-   **Study:** The highest-level grouping, representing a complete research question (e.g., comparing "correct" vs. "random" mappings).
-   **Experiment:** A complete set of runs for a single experimental condition (e.g., all runs for the "correct" mapping condition).
-   **Replication:** A single, complete run of an experiment, repeated multiple times for statistical power.
-   **Trial:** An individual matching task performed within a replication.

## The Research Workflow

The end-to-end process is designed around a clear, two-stage workflow: first, you create an **Experiment** for each condition; second, you group them into a **Study** for final analysis.

### Stage 1: Create Experiments for Each Condition

This stage focuses on generating the raw data. For each condition, you will configure `config.ini` and use the following scripts:

-   **`new_experiment.ps1` (Create)**: The primary script for data generation. It runs a full set of replications for one condition.
-   **`audit_experiment.ps1` (Check)**: A read-only diagnostic tool to check the status and health of an experiment.
-   **`fix_experiment.ps1` (Fix)**: If an experiment is interrupted, this script intelligently resumes it.

### Stage 2: Compile and Analyze the Study

Once you have a separate experiment directory for each of your conditions, you can analyze them together as a single study.

1.  **Organize Experiments**: Manually move all completed experiment directories into a single parent folder (e.g., `output/studies/My_First_Study/`).

2.  **Audit the Study (`audit_study.ps1`)**: Run this read-only script on your study directory to perform a consolidated health check on all experiments.

3.  **Compile the Study (`compile_study.ps1`)**: This is the final step. It aggregates all data, runs the statistical analysis, and generates the publication-ready reports and plots.
