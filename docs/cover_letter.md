**Subject: Submission of a preprint for evaluation and recommendation: "[Your Article's Title]"**

Dear Drs. Bottesini, Howard, Moore, Syed, and Tackett,

We are pleased to submit our preprint, "**[Your Article's Title]**," for evaluation and potential recommendation by Peer Community in Psychology. This manuscript introduces a novel, computationally reproducible framework that directly addresses the challenge of bringing empirical rigor to the study of complex, narrative-based systems within psychological science.

This work was designed from its inception to embody the principles of transparency and reproducibility that are at the heart of the PCI initiative. In accordance with your submission guidelines, we have made the entire research workflow publicly available. The submission includes a complete public repository containing all raw data, analysis scripts, the neutralized component library, and detailed documentation. We have also included a completed TOP disclosure table in the manuscript's appendix.

As a challenging case study to validate our framework, we apply it to the domain of astrology. Our findings indicate the presence of a faint but statistically significant signal, a result we interpret with appropriate caution using both frequentist and Bayesian analyses. We believe that demonstrating that even a highly contentious "hard problem" can be approached with objective, verifiable methods is a powerful testament to the value of this open-science paradigm.

We understand that PCI Psychology employs a rigorous, multi-stage review process, and we are confident that our work will meet your high standards for methodological and analytical soundness. We have suggested several potential Recommenders with expertise in computational methods, psychometrics, and open science in the submission form to assist the process.

Thank you for considering our work for recommendation. We believe it is an excellent fit for your mission and will be of great interest to the community.

Sincerely,

**[Your Name(s)]**
