**Subject: Submission of a new manuscript for consideration: "[Your Article's Title]"**

Dear Editors,

We are pleased to submit our manuscript, "**[Your Article's Title]**," for consideration for publication in *Meta-Psychology*. This paper introduces a novel, fully transparent, and computationally reproducible framework for the empirical investigation of complex narrative systems, a significant challenge within psychological science.

Our work is a direct response to the journal's call for contributions that advance psychology as a science. We present not just a study, but a complete open-science paradigm. By leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM) as an automated arbiter, we demonstrate how a controversial and methodologically difficult topic—astrology—can be approached with unprecedented rigor. Our primary contribution is the open-source software and methodology itself, which is designed to be adapted for other "hard-to-quantify" domains in psychology.

This manuscript is a perfect fit for *Meta-Psychology* because it embodies the journal's core principles:
1.  **Extreme Transparency:** The entire research workflow, from data curation to the final analysis script, is publicly available and documented. Our submission is designed to be seamlessly integrated with your OSF-based review process.
2.  **Statistical Reproducibility:** We are confident our work will meet the standards of your statistical reproduction team and earn the reproducibility badge, a feature that was a key factor in our decision to submit to your journal.
3.  **Methodological Advancement:** The paper's central focus is the introduction of a new method and software tool for the field, one that directly addresses the challenges of bias and reproducibility.

We deliberately chose a challenging case study to demonstrate the robustness of our open-science framework. We believe this work will be of great interest to your readership and will contribute to the ongoing conversation about how psychological science can be made more rigorous and transparent.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
