**Subject: Submission of a preprint for evaluation and recommendation: "A Framework for Reproducible Testing of Complex Narrative Systems: A Case Study in Astrology"**

Dear Drs. Bottesini, Howard, Moore, Syed, and Tackett,

We are pleased to submit our preprint, "A Framework for Reproducible Testing of Complex Narrative Systems: A Case Study in Astrology," for evaluation and potential recommendation by Peer Community in Psychology. This manuscript's primary contribution is the introduction and validation of the *LLM Narrative Framework*, a novel, open-source, and fully automated methodology designed to bring empirical rigor to complex areas of psychological science that have historically resisted quantitative assessment.

This work was designed from its inception to align with PCI's mission of promoting transparent, verifiable, and reproducible science. The entire research workflow is publicly available in a comprehensive repository containing all data, source code (41,000+ lines), and extensive documentation. To further facilitate a transparent and efficient review, we have completed the PCI Psychology self-assessment questionnaire and can confirm that all materials are accessible, documented, and function as described. A completed TOP disclosure table is also included as an appendix in the manuscript.

The framework's capabilities are demonstrated through a rigorous case study on the challenging and contentious topic of astrology. While the framework successfully identifies a faint but statistically significant signal, the more critical findings are methodological: we uncover a "Goldilocks effect" where signal detection peaks at a specific task difficulty and reveal extreme (575-fold) heterogeneity in the capabilities of different AI models. These insights underscore that the framework is not just a tool, but a sensitive instrument that requires careful calibration.

We believe this work is an ideal fit for PCI Psychology. It directly addresses the replication crisis by offering a practical, scalable, and transparent paradigm for future research into narrative systems. We are confident that our methodology and findings will withstand your rigorous review process and will be of significant interest to the psychological science community.

Thank you for considering our manuscript for recommendation.

Sincerely,\
Peter J. Marko and Kenneth McRitchie\
